Anchored by Crumb's contributions to the seminal anthology <em>Weirdo</em>, created and edited by Crumb, this volume includes the first several appearances of classic Crumb character Mode O' Day, the networking fashion plate that serves as a foil for some of Crumb's most biting satire about America's cultural "elite." Other <em>Weirdo</em> highlights include Crumb's fascinating adaptation of Dr. R. Von Krafft-Ebing's "Psychopathia Sexualis," and "Where Has it Gone, all the Beautiful Music of Our Grandparents?", two stories often-cited as being amongst Crumb's very best work. The <em>Weirdo</em> section wraps up with yet another classic, "The Religious Experience of Philip K. Dick," which chronicles the last years of the highly-regarded science-fiction writer who experienced an intense vision of the apocalypse and believed that he was possessed by the spirit of Elijah.<br><br> Also included are Crumb's first collaborations with the late writer Charles Bukowski, including the chapbook "Bring Me Your Love," as well as several collaborations with Harvey Pekar from his autobiographical series <em>American Splendor</em>. The book is rounded out with a color section that includes rare album art for various jazz and blues greats, as well reproductions of his various comic book covers from this period. Crumb is the most revealing of all artists, and <em>The Complete Crumb Comics</em> leaves no stone unturned. Featuring a lengthy introduction by Peter Bagge. 16 pages of color; black-and-white comics throughout</p><p><p>Born in Philadelphia, <strong>R. Crumb</strong> is the author of numerous comic works and one of the pioneers of underground comics and arguably one of the most famous cartoonists in history. His books include&nbsp;<em>The Book of Genesis Illustrated by R. Crumb</em>, and many more. He lives in the south of France with his wife, the artist Aline Kominsky-Crumb.</p><p><strong>Peter Bagge</strong> created&nbsp;<em>Hate</em>, one of the best-selling and most formative comic book series of the &#x2019;90s. Born in New York in 1957, after graduating from the School of Visual Arts, Bagge contributed to and, along with R. Crumb, edited the underground anthology <em>Weirdo</em>. Since then Bagge's numerous original graphic novels and collections of comics have won him two Harvey Awards (one for Best Cartoonist in 1991), an Inkpot Award, and garnered six Eisner Award nominations. His social commentary cartoons run in the magazine <em>Reason</em>, and his recent biography of Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger is critically acclaimed. He lives in Seattle, Washington.</p><p><strong>Harvey Pekar</strong> (1939-2010) was a comic book writer and author of the autobiographical <em>American Splendor</em> series, which was adapted into an Academy Award nominated film. Pekar was also a prolific jazz and book critic.</p>The latest volume of everything underground comics creator Crumb has done consists largely of his contributions to <i>Weirdo</i>, the comics magazine he edited in the '80s. A good chunk of the book is devoted to stories of a lesser Crumb character, the one-note poseur Mode O'day. Fortunately, it also includes generous representations of stronger work--collaborations with writer Harvey Pekar, autobiographical efforts (including a "jam" with his wife, Aline Kominsky-Crumb), a jeremiad against contemporary culture ("Where Has It Gone, All the Beautiful Music of Our Grandparents?"), illustrations for books by Charles Bukowski and Edward Abbey, and a generous color portfolio of <i>Weirdo</i> covers and record-album jackets. Best of all is Crumb's affectionate biographical story of delta-blues legend Charlie Patton. Crumb can no longer be considered an underground cartoonist by any stretch of the imagination; thanks largely to the acclaimed documentary film <i>Crumb</i>, he might just be the nation's best-known cartoonist. That means libraries can expect demand for this as well as the other volumes in the series. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She lives in Palm Desert, California.I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD. What do you know when you&#x2019;re seven years old? All my life, or so I thought, we&#x2019;d been in the city of Alexandria, in the Street of the Carpenters, with the other Galileans, and sooner or later we were going home.<br> &nbsp;<br> Late afternoon. We were playing, my gang against his, and when he ran at me again, bully that he was, bigger than me, and catching me off balance, I felt the power go out of me as I shouted: &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never get where you&#x2019;re going.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He fell down white in the sandy earth, and they all crowded around him. The sun was hot and my chest was heaving as I looked at him. He was so limp&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In the snap of two fingers everyone drew back. It seemed the whole street went quiet except for the carpenters&#x2019; hammers. I&#x2019;d never heard such a quiet.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s dead!&#x201d; Little Joses said. And then they all took it up. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s dead, he&#x2019;s dead, he&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I knew it was true. He was a bundle of arms and legs in the beaten dust.<br> &nbsp;<br> And I was empty. The power had taken everything with it, all gone.<br> &nbsp;<br> His mother came out of the house, and her scream went up the walls into a howl. From everywhere the women came running.<br> &nbsp;<br> My mother lifted me off my feet. She carried me down the street and through the courtyard and into the dark of our house. All my cousins crowded in with us, and James, my big brother, pulled the curtain shut. He turned his back on the light. He said:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Jesus did it. He killed him.&#x201d; He was afraid.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you say such a thing!&#x201d; said my mother. She clutched me so close to her, I could scarcely breathe.<br> &nbsp;<br> Big Joseph woke up.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now Big Joseph was my father, because he was married to my mother, but I&#x2019;d never called him Father. I&#x2019;d been taught to call him Joseph. I didn&#x2019;t know why.<br> &nbsp;<br> He&#x2019;d been asleep on the mat. We&#x2019;d worked all day on a job in Philo&#x2019;s house, and he and the rest of the men had lain down in the heat of the afternoon to sleep. He climbed to his feet.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that shouting outside?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happened?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He looked to James. James was his eldest son. James was the son of a wife who had died before Joseph married my mother.<br> &nbsp;<br> James said it again.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Jesus killed Eleazer. Jesus cursed him and he fell down dead.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Joseph stared at me, his face still blank from sleep. There was more and more shouting in the street. He rose to his feet, and ran his hands back through his thick curly hair.<br> &nbsp;<br> My little cousins were slipping through the door one by one and crowding around us.<br> &nbsp;<br> My mother was trembling. &#x201c;He couldn&#x2019;t have done it,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He wouldn&#x2019;t do such a thing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I saw it,&#x201d; said James. &#x201c;I saw it when he made the sparrows out of clay on the Sabbath. The teacher told him he shouldn&#x2019;t do such things on the Sabbath. Jesus looked at the birds and they turned into real birds. They flew away. You saw it too. He killed Eleazer, Mother, I saw it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My cousins made a ring of white faces in the shadows: Little Joses, Judas, and Little Symeon and Salome, watching anxiously, afraid of being sent out. Salome was my age, and my dearest and closest. Salome was like my sister.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then in came my mother&#x2019;s brother Cleopas, always the talker, who was the father of these cousins, except for Big Silas who came in now, a boy older than James. He went into the corner, and then came his brother, Levi, and both wanted to see what was going on.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Joseph, they&#x2019;re all out there,&#x201d; said Cleopas, &#x201c;Jonathan bar Zakkai, and his brothers, they&#x2019;re saying Jesus killed their boy. They&#x2019;re envious that we got that job at Philo&#x2019;s house, they&#x2019;re envious that we got the other job before that, they&#x2019;re envious that we&#x2019;re getting more and more jobs, they&#x2019;re so sure they do things better than we do&#x2014;.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is the boy dead?&#x201d; Joseph said. &#x201c;Or is the boy alive?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Salome shot forward and whispered in my ear. &#x201c;Just make him come alive, Jesus, the way you made the birds come alive!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Little Symeon was giggling. He was too little to know what was going on. Little Judas knew, but he was quiet.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Stop,&#x201d; said James, the little boss of the children. &#x201c;Salome, be quiet.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I could hear them shouting in the street. I heard other noises. Stones were hitting the walls of the house. My mother started to cry.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You dare do that!&#x201d; shouted my uncle Cleopas and he rushed back out through the door. Joseph went after him.<br> &nbsp;<br> I wriggled out of my mother&#x2019;s grasp and darted out before she could catch me, and past my uncle and Joseph and right into the crowd as they were all waving and hollering and shaking their fists. I went so fast, they didn&#x2019;t even see me. I was like a fish in the river. I moved in and out through people who were shouting over my head until I got to Eleazer&#x2019;s house.<br> &nbsp;<br> The women all had their backs to the door, and they didn&#x2019;t see me as I went around the edge of the room.<br> &nbsp;<br> I went right into the dark room, where they&#x2019;d laid him on the mat. His mother was there leaning on her sister and sobbing.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was only one lamp, very weak.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eleazer was pale with his arms at his sides, same soiled tunic, and the soles of his feet very black. He was dead. His mouth was open and his white teeth showed over his lip.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Greek physician came in&#x2014;he was really a Jew&#x2014;and he knelt down, and he looked at Eleazer and he shook his head.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then he saw me and said:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Out.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His mother turned and she saw it was me and she screamed.<br> &nbsp;<br> I bent over him:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wake up, Eleazer,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Wake up now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I reached out and laid my hand on his forehead.<br> &nbsp;<br> The power went out. My eyes closed. I was dizzy. But I heard him draw in his breath.<br> &nbsp;<br> His mother screamed over and over and it hurt my ears. Her sister screamed. All the women were screaming.<br> &nbsp;<br> I fell back on the floor. I was weak. The Greek physician was staring down at me. I was sick. The room was dim. Other people had rushed in.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eleazer came up, and he was up all knees and fists before anyone could get to him, and he set on me and punched me and hit me, and knocked my head back against the ground, and kicked me again and again:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Son of David, Son of David!&#x201d; he shouted, mocking me, &#x201c;Son of David, Son of David!&#x201d; kicking me in the face, and in the ribs, until his father grabbed him around the waist and picked him up in the air.<br> &nbsp;<br> I ached all over, couldn&#x2019;t breathe.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Son of David!&#x201d; Eleazer kept shouting.<br> &nbsp;<br> Someone lifted me and carried me out of the house and into the crowd in the street. I was still gasping. I hurt all over. It seemed the whole street was screaming, worse than before, and someone said the Teacher was coming, and my uncle Cleopas was yelling in Greek at Jonathan, Eleazer&#x2019;s father, and Jonathan was yelling back, and Eleazer was shouting, &#x201c;Son of David, Son of David!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I was in Joseph&#x2019;s arms. He was trying to move, but the crowd wouldn&#x2019;t let him. Cleopas was pushing at Eleazer&#x2019;s father. Eleazer&#x2019;s father was trying to get at Cleopas, but other men took hold of his arms. I heard Eleazer shouting far away.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was the Teacher declaring: &#x201c;That child&#x2019;s not dead, you hush up, Eleazer, who said he was dead? Eleazer, stop shouting! Whoever could think this child is dead?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Brought him back to life, that&#x2019;s what he did,&#x201d; said one of theirs.<br> &nbsp;<br> We were in our courtyard, the entire crowd had pushed in with us, my uncle and Eleazer&#x2019;s people still screaming at each other, and the Teacher demanding order.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now my uncles, Alphaeus and Simon, had come. These were Joseph&#x2019;s brothers. And they&#x2019;d just woken up. They put up their hands against the crowd. Their mouths were hard and their eyes were big.<br> &nbsp;<br> My aunts, Salome and Esther and Mary, were there, with all the cousins running and jumping as if this were a festival, except for Silas and Levi and James who stood with the men.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Eclipse At Noon (Deathlands, 33)</h2><p>Finding themselves on board the remains of a Mississippi pleasure boat, Ryan Cawdor and his band of warrior survivalists enjoy gambling with its genial captain, until the stakes escalate to human life proportions. Original.</p><p></p><h2>This Is Not It: Stories by Lynne Tillman</h2><p>In <i>This Is Not It,</i> Lynne Tillman's collection of 20 years' worth of important and compelling short stories and novellas, the protagonists seduce you into their lives and thoughts. Engaging, funny, elegant and ironic, Tillman takes the reader to new heights of wit and meaning through staccato phrases, grammatical twists and sensuous language. Familiar worlds of honesty, deceit, dark humor, pleasure, pain, confusion, dependence, love and lust each play decisive roles in her believable fictions. In "Come and Go," three characters and an author collide. In "Pleasure Isn't a Pretty Picture," the reader is treated to a he/she meditation on the one-night stand. And "Dead Sleep" is truly an insomniac's worst nightmare. A twin act on a double bill, <i>This Is Not It</i> is a collection of innovative and stand-alone writing that also engages and matches wits with the some of the best contemporary art: work by Kiki Smith, Jane Dickson, Jessica Stockholder, Diller &amp; Scofidio, Laura Letinsky, Peter Dreher, Roni Horn, Stephen Ellis, Juan Munoz, Vik Muniz, Silvia Kolbowski, Jeff Koons, James Welling, Aura Rosenberg, Barbara Ess, Barbara Kruger, Dolores Marat, Haim Steinbach, Gary Schneider, Marco Breuer, Stephen Prina and Linder Sterling. Since 1982, acclaimed novelist Tillman has created these unique narratives that are a parallel universe to the contemporary art world. Maybe they're analogues or dialogues, maybe fictions inspired by art, maybe reflections, or meditations--but whatever they're called, like Borges's fictions, they are their own worlds, too. Tillman has marked out terrain of her own, which this collection celebrates. Full of life and art, <i>This Is Not It</i> is illuminating, bold, subtle and riotous.</p><p>Lynne Tillman is the author of the novels <i>Haunted Houses</i>; <i>Motion Sickness</i>; <i>Cast in Doubt</i>; and <i>No Lease on Life</i>, a New York Times Notable Book of 1998 and a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award; and the story collections <i>Absence Makes the Heart</i> and <i>The Madame Realism Complex</i>. Her non-fiction books include <i>The Velvet Years: Warhol's Factory 1965-1967</i> and <i>The Broad Picture</i>. Tillman's fiction is anthologized in, among others, <i> The New Gothic, The Norton Anthology of Postmodern Literature, The Time Out Book of New York Stories</i>, and <i>High Risk</i>. She writes regularly on art, books, and culture and contributes frequently to artists' books and museum catalogues. She lives in New York.A kind of career retrospective for Tillman (No Lease on Life), this collection of formally innovative stories from the last 20 years (most of them previously published) follows a cast of artists and grunts from a vanishing New York City bohemia. Or at least those are the characters that one can identify-Tillman uses stylized, anonymous narrators in some of her more minimalist tales. In "Pleasure Isn't a Pretty Picture," a summary of a sexual encounter, Tillman pulls apart the male and female parts of the dialogue and lists them as two different scripts ("She said: That's all right. She said: Are you crying? She said: Again. She said: Almost. She said: You tell that to all the girls"). "Come and Go" shifts deftly among the perspectives of three different characters who pass through the same hospital waiting room: a heroin addict, a psychic social worker with a twisted ankle and a man waiting to hear whether he has cancer. The final section of the story is told from the perspective of the writer who has created these three. Many of the stories are inspired by, or complement works of, contemporary art, and each one has its own title page with a full-color painting or photograph by such artists as Kiki Smith and Jeff Koons. Though some readers may not have the patience for her experimental story structures, others will enjoy her nuanced interior monologues and amusing explorations of how best to reproduce human consciousness on paper. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Zigazak! A Magical Hanukkah Night</h2><p><i>&#x201c;The most imaginative Hannukah tale of the season.&#x201d;&#x2014;</i>Publishers Weekly<br><br>On the first night of Hanukkah, two tricky devils arrive in the town of Brisk to cause mischief. They use a magic word &#x2014; <i>Zigazak!</i> &#x2014; to make dreidels dance and latkes fly. The good citizens of Brisk panic and appeal to their wise rabbi for help. He triumphs over the devils in a contest of wits, and soon sends them packing. But his real triumph is the ability to see the good in all things, even devils&#x2019; tricks, helping the townsfolk enjoy their most magical Hanukkah ever.<br><br>&#x201c;The breezy text and expressive humor of the illustrations make this a fine choice for Hanukkah storytimes.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;School Library Journal<br><br>An Association of Jewish Libraries Notable Book for Young Readers</i></p><p>Is Hanukkah really all about dancing dreidels and high-flying latkes? Maybe not, but Eric Kimmel and Jon Goodell have put these devilish phenomena to good use in a lighthearted story that teaches Hanukkah traditions--from <i>kazatzkas</i> to gelt--along with a wise, timeless moral. The tale's decidedly unscary antagonists are a couple of bumbling devils determined to cause Hanukkah-night mischief in the village of Brisk. Goodell's clearly having fun as he sends five dreidels into a tight little jig, launches latkes around Hannah Leah's kitchen, and sets off some menorah pyrotechnics in Menachem Mendel's home. But Brisk's frightened villagers need not worry: they've got a clever rabbi who's not only unafraid of the devils' antics--he enjoys them! When dreidels sprout legs and dance on his table, "he laughed and clapped his hands. 'Delightful!' he exclaimed. 'Show me more.'" As with the misadventures of Fat Albert, kids reading <i>Zigazak!</i> should be careful--otherwise, they just might learn something. And that goes for both Hanukkah minutiae and the wise rabbi's moral: "Sparks of holiness exist in all things, even in devils' tricks. And if we look hard enough, we can find the good in all living creatures." (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Paul Hughes</i>On the first night of Hanukkah, two tricky devils arrive in the town of Brisk to cause mischief. They use a magic word -- &#34;zigazak! -- to make dreidels dance and latkes fly. The good citizens of Brisk panic and appeal to their wise rabbi for help.

Formed in 1943 as a Bew�hrungsverband for special missions (guerrilla operations in the Balkans) the unit was deployed at many focal points of heavy combat on the eastern and western fronts. Nearly destroyed at the Schwedt and Alt-K�strinchen bridgeheads, the remainder pulled back to the west over Parchim at the end of April 1945 and entered U.S. captivity in May 1945. This is their story, including extremely rare photographs.</p><p>Rolf Michaelis specializes in books on the Waffen-SS and has written over thirty to date, with many available in English from Schiffer Books.

He has written several New York Times bestsellers, most recently The Director. He lives in Washington, D.C.The factional strife in Lebanon feeds on rumor, deliberate lies, and half-truths, and spawns mercenaries and agents of every ideological stripe. Most share a harsh morality that allows terrorism to advance. A very few others are committed to relationships built on trust, honesty, and a sense of mutual responsibility. One such is Tom Rogers, a CIA agent who penetrates a prime Palestinian unit and makes a secret agreement with a young deputy chief of Fatah intelligence. This first novel is a suspenseful account of the excruciating ambiguity of the undertaking. Ignatius, a former Middle East correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, writes with a fatalistic affection for his subject and deep understanding of its complexity. As a storyteller, Ignatius deploys drama, pace, and character to make this a spy novel of formidable power.

In these pages he tells the complete story of Ball&#39;s Bluff for the first time.For every high-school teacher who has been greeted with yawns of boredom at the mere mention of the Civil War, help is here. Farwell's lucid and gripping account of the tiny battle of Ball's Bluff and its aftermath will wake up the most jaded history student. The book is wonderfully self-contained; no previous knowledge of the period or circumstances is necessary. Farwell provides background, introduces readers to the all-too-human cast of characters, guides them through the frequently confusing course of battle, and follows the hair-raising consequences of what should have been a minor skirmish. The period photographs and illustrations and frequent use of quotations from first-hand accounts create a vivid picture of the time and place. The particular relevance to our own time--the political search for a scapegoat--will be a familiar spectacle for all but the most oblivious. This is a book to engage and provoke, to launch an exploration, or to bring to life an investigation. For those already blessed with a corps of Civil War buffs, it will be a joy. --Cathy Chauvette, Fairfax County Public Library, VA<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Watercolors for Beginners</h2><p>HARD TO FIND</p><p></p><h2>Fresno Memories: The Early Years</h2><p>The Fresno Bee is proud to announce a beautiful, hardcover historic retrospective of the Greater Fresno area.

But when they turn the final corner, the surprise Polarhog has prepared brings a tear to Barry&#x2019;s eye and yours.</p><p>Ren�e French lives in California with her husband Rob in a beige-colored house. The best birthday present she got as a child was a giant box of art supplies as big as her body. Growing up, she would play hooky from school in order to lie on the couch all day and draw which, in fact, is exactly what she does all day long now. Renowned as the author of many books of comics for both adults and children (including H Day, Micrographia, and The Ticking), she&#x2019;s been nominated for best artist by the Eisner, Harvey, and Ignatz Awards.French turns in a first-level reader that bares none of the disturbing hallmarks of her previous works, like the award-nominated The Ticking (2006) or Micrographica (2007). Instead, the tale of Polarhog&#x2019;s attempt to pull his friend Barry the Bird out of a humdrum existence is told in generous two-page spreads that give the environments a lustrous feeling and allow readers to appreciate the idiosyncratic personalities packed into the characters&#x2019; distinctive faces. Alternating subdued colors with much brighter ones also helps breathe lovely life into some of the book&#x2019;s visual punch lines. The needs and nuances of children&#x2019;s literature are well represented, as echoes of Arnold Lobel&#x2019;s Frog and Toad books find their way into the slightly morose Barry and his upbeat pal, and friendship and cooperation are the key themes here, with Polarhog arranging a colorful surprise with the help of some friendly ants. Naturally, in the tradition of curmudgeons since time immemorial, Barry is eventually won over by his friend&#x2019;s love and devotion. Yet another winner from TOON.

One central image of the book is grass, a plant that usurps empires and breaks through abandoned concrete. The transience of specific places, even the entire Earth, is illuminated, and the far future of the sun enveloping the world (what astronomers say will happen in several billion years) is mentioned more than once. The reader confronts the impermanence of life.</p><p></p><h2>The New House</h2><p>&#39;All that outwardly happens in The New House,&#39; writes Jilly Cooper in her Persephone preface, &#39;is over one long day a family moves from a large imposing secluded house with beautiful gardens to a small one overlooking a housing estate. But all the characters and their relationships with each other are so lovingly portrayed that one cares passionately what happens even to the unpleasant ones. &#39;The New House, first published in 1936, reminds me of my favourite author Chekhov, who so influenced Lettice&#39;s generation of writers. Like him, she had perfect social pitch and could draw an arriviste developer as convincingly as a steely Southern social butterfly.&#39; &#39;It is tempting to describe Rhoda Powell, the 30-plus, stay-at-home daughter of a widowed mother, as Brookneresque,&#39; wrote the reviewer in the Guardian, &#39;even though Lettice Cooper wrote this wonderfully understated novel several decades before Anita Brookner mapped the defining features of quietly unhappy middle-class women.&#39; Kate Chisholm in the Spectator described Lettice Cooper as &#39;an intensely domestic novelist, unraveling in minute detail the tight web of family relations&#39; but one who is also &#39;acutely aware of what goes on beyond the garden gate. The expos� of a family under strain because of changing times is curiously more vivid and real than in many novels about family life written today.&#39;</p><p></p><h2>The Hyena and the Hawk (3) (Echoes of the Fall)</h2><p>They face a hunger that could consume the gods themselves From the depths of myth an ancient enemy has returned: the Plague People, whose very presence obliterates whole villages; whose terror destroys minds. In their wake, nothing is left of the people, not their places, not their ways. On the plains, the warriors and the wise of all tribes gather to confront the aggressor. Loud Thunder leads his great war-host south, even as Tecumet and Asman head north with the Sun River army. With Maniye Many Tracks, they plan to forge a new unity between the tribes such as the world has never seen. But will it be enough to stave off an oblivion that might devour even their gods? Their adversary&#x2019;s presence is like a wound in the world, and wakes all the old terrors and evils from the peoples&#x2019; stories. But before they can deal with the enemies without, they must conquer their demons within.The Hyena and the Hawk is the third book in Adrian Tchaikovsky's epic fantasy trilogy, Echoes of the Fall, following The Bear and the Serpent.</p><p><b>Adrian Tchaikovsky</b> studied psychology and zoology at Reading.

Since Florida has ocean access on the east, west, and south, and numerous waterways that serve the interior, the state&#x2019;s development has been greatly influenced by the rivers that wind through its beautiful and varied landscape. The people and vessels that traveled these waters were an integral part of the region&#x2019;s economy and took part in the often romanticized steamboat era. Of all Florida&#x2019;s natural waterways, the St. Johns River was perhaps the best suited for steamboat use, and the Ocklawaha River was one of its main tributaries. These valuable river routes encouraged the growth and prosperity of such Florida towns as Jacksonville, St. Augustine, Fernandina, and Palatka, and tourist attractions such as Silver Springs.</p><p>Maritime Historian Edward A. Mueller has compiled a fascinating visual account of the steamboat era in northern Florida. With images that document both the remarkable vessels and the people who spent much of their lives on the St. Johns and Ocklawaha Rivers, this pictorial journey tells the story of a time that has long passed, when travel and trade were dictated by the river&#x2019;s flow.</p><h2>An Emperor For The Legion</h2><p>Foul sorcery had slain the Emperor.

With a new Introduction by Alain de Botton.</p><p>This sparkling curiosity was inspired by Ian Fleming, who had the fine idea of asking eminent writers to comment on the deadly sins for <i>THE TIMES</i> of London. The result is a witty display of erudition as each author essays his or her assigned vice&#x2014;Auden &#x201c;Anger,&#x201d; Connolly &#x201c;Covetousness,&#x201d; Wilson &#x201c;Envy,&#x201d; Leigh Fermor &#x201c;Gluttony,&#x201d; Sykes &#x201c;Lust,&#x201d; Sitwell &#x201c;Pride,&#x201d; and Waugh &#x201c;Sloth.&#x201d;In 1962, Ian Fleming, as a member of the editorial board of the London Sunday Times, thought it would be entertaining to ask a handful of Britain's top writers to pen essays on the seven deadly sins. He tapped W.H. Auden, Cyril Connolly, Patrick Leigh-Fermer, Edith Sitwell, Christopher Sykes, Evelyn Waugh, and Angus Wilson to contribute their thoughts on anger, covetousness, gluttony, pride, lust, sloth, and envy, respectively. Some approached the assignment with the utmost seriousness, others with humor. Regardless of tack, the result was very readable. This edition contains a new afterword by Alain de Botton. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Evolution of Operational Art</h2><p>From the foreword: &#34;Bruce Menning&#39;s translation of Georgii Samoilovich Isserson&#39;s 1936 treatise The Evolution of Operational Art is the best example available of the distillation of Soviet military thought before the Second World War. Isserson, Tukhachevsky, Shaposhnikov, and others like them were founding members of a focused military Enlightenment whose goal was to change the way armies and leaders thought about war. Moreover, unlike contemporaries such as B.H. Liddell Hart or Billy Mitchell, they had the opportunity to build their ideas into the modern Soviet Army and see their doctrine survive despite the existential challenges of Stalin&#39;s purges and the German invasion. I commend this work to you as a foundational text, one to which I hope you will refer repeatedly throughout your career.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Elizabeth David Classics: &#34;Mediterranean Food&#34;, &#34;French Country Cooking&#34; and &#34;Summer Cooking&#34;</h2><p>London published Cooking</p><p></p><h2>Rug Hooking In Maine: 1838-1940</h2><p>This fresh and scholarly look at a century of rug hooking in Maine demonstrates the significant role non-woven rugs have played in American decorative arts. True Waldoboro rugs are explored in detail and the myth of &#34;Acadian&#34; rugs is explained. Edward Sands Frost manufactured preprinted burlap rug patterns in the mid-19th century that spawned competitions across the country. By the 1880s, summer visitors helped organize cottage industries that turned Maine&#39;s rug-hooking talents into income producers. The Arts and Crafts movement in America led to new and exciting styles of rug patterns in Maine, and by the early 20th century, artists pushed the craft of rug hooking in to a fine art, with Marguerite Zorach&#39;s designs among the prominent examples. This lavishly illustrated book has over 250 color photographs that highlight the extraordinary story of rugs created throughout Maine and eastern Canada, including popular maritime designs by men of the seas.</p><p>Maine native Mildred Cole Peladeau organized the hooked rug exhibit and wrote the catalog for the American d104ile History Museum in Lowell, Massachusetts. In 2007, she lectured on Maines handmade rugs at the American Folk Art Museum in New York City, during the special rug exhibition.

A 10th-degree black belt regarded as a pioneer in popularizing these disciplines in the West, Keith D. Yates is in a unique position to expand practitioners&#x2019; knowledge. Illustrated throughout with black-and-white photos, this book discusses in clear, cogent language the origins of karate and tae kwon do, their philosophical underpinnings, and how they evolved in America. Yates also offers authoritative practical information on such common student concerns as the difference between karate and tae kwon do, the requirements for earning a black belt (and the different kinds of black belts), the best style to learn for self-defense, the significance and effectiveness of forms, and even how to find a legitimate school or instructor. Also featuring inspiring short biographies of some of the most famous figures in American karate, <i>The Complete Guide to American Karate and Tae Kwon Do </i>helps students understand both the &#x201c;how&#x201d; and the &#x201c;why&#x201d; of these vital martial arts traditions.</p><p>Keith D.

In the howling speed-turmoil of a BSA M20 doing seventy, they were the only quiet things in the hurtling flesh and metal. Protected by the glass of the goggles, they stared fixedly ahead from just above the centre of the handlebars, and their dark, unwavering focus was that of gun muzzles. Below the goggles, the wind had got into the face through the mouth and had wrenched the lips back into a square grin that showed big tombstone teeth and strips of whitish gum. On both sides of the grin the cheeks had been blown out by the wind into pouches that fluttered slightly. To right and left of the hurtling face under the crash helmet, the black gauntlets, broken-wristed at the controls, looked like the attacking paws of a big animal.</p> <p>The man was dressed in the uniform of a dispatch-rider in the Royal Corps of Signals, and his machine, painted olive green, was, with certain modifications to the valves and the carburettor and the removal of some of the silencer baffles to give more speed, identical with a standard British Army machine. There was nothing in the man or his equipment to suggest that he was not what he appeared to be, except a fully loaded Luger held by a clip to the top of the petrol tank.</p> <p>It was seven o'clock on a May morning and the dead straight road through the forest glittered with the tiny luminous mist of spring. On both sides of the road the moss- and flower- carpeted depths between the great oak trees held the theatrical enchantment of the royal forests of Versailles and St Germain. The road was D98, a secondary road serving local traffic in the St Germain area, and the motorcyclist had just passed beneath the Paris-Mantes autoroute already thundering with commuter traffic for Paris. He was heading north towards St Germain and there was no one else in sight in either direction, except, perhaps half a mile ahead, an almost identical figure - another Royal Corps dispatch-rider. He was a younger, slimmer man and he sat com-fortably back on his machine, enjoying the morning and keeping his speed to around forty. He was well on time and it was a beautiful day. He wondered whether to have his eggs fried or scrambled when he got back to HQ around eight.</p> <p>Five hundred yards, four hundred, three, two, one. The man coming up from behind slowed to fifty. He put his right gauntlet up to his teeth and pulled it off. He stuffed the gauntlet between the buttons of his tunic and reached down and unclipped the gun.</p> <p>By now he must have been big in the driving-mirror of the young man ahead, for suddenly the young man jerked his head round, surprised to find another dispatch-rider on his run at that time of the morning. He expected that it would be an American or perhaps French military police. It might be anyone from the eight NATO nations that made up the staff of SHAPE, but when he recognized the uniform of the Corps he was astonished and delighted. Who the hell could it be? He raised a cheerful right thumb in recognition and cut his speed to thirty, waiting for the other man to drift up alongside. With one eye on the road ahead and the other on the approaching silhouette in the mirror, he ran through the names of the British riders in the Special Service Transportation Unit at Headquarters Command. Albert, Sid, Wally - might be Wally, same thick build. Good show! He'd be able to pull his leg about that little frog bit in the canteen - Louise, Elise, Lise - what the hell was her name. &#x2014; The man with the gun had slowed. Now he was fifty yards away. His face, undistorted by the wind, had set into blunt, hard, perhaps Slav lines. A red spark burned behind the black, aimed muzzles of the eyes. Forty yards, thirty. A single magpie flew out of the forest ahead of the young dispatch-rider. It fled clumpsily across the road into the bushes behind a Michelin sign that said that St Germain was one kilometre to go. The young man grinned and raised an ironical finger in salute and self-protection - 'One magpie is sorrow'. &#x2014; Twenty yards behind him the man with the gun took both hands off the handlebars, lifted the Luger, rested it carefully on his left forearm and fired one shot. &#x2014; The young man's hands whipped off his controls and met across the centre of his backward-arching spine. His machine veered across the road, jumped a narrow ditch and ploughed into a patch of grass and lilies of the valley. There it rose up on its screaming back wheel and slowly crashed backwards on top of its dead rider. The BSA coughed and kicked and tore at the young man's clothes and at the flowers, and then lay quiet. &#x2014; The killer executed a narrow turn and stopped with his machine pointing back the way he had come. He stamped down the wheel-rest, pulled his machine up on to it and walked in among the wild flowers under the trees. He knelt down beside the dead man and brusquely pulled back an eyelid. Just as roughly he tore the black leather dispatch-case off the corpse and ripped open the buttons of the tunic and removed a battered leather wallet. He wrenched a cheap wristwatch so sharply off the left wrist that the chrome expanding bracelet snapped in half. He stood up and slung the dispatch-case over his shoulder. While he stowed the wallet and the watch away in his tunic pocket he listened. There were only forest sounds and the slow tick of hot metal from the crashed BSA. The killer retraced his steps to the road. He walked slowly, scuffing leaves over the tyre marks in the soft earth and moss. He took extra trouble over the deep scars in the ditch and the grass verge, and then stood beside his motor-cycle and looked back towards the lily of the valley patch. Not bad! Probably only the police dogs would get it, and, with ten miles of road to cover, they would be hours, perhaps days - plenty long enough. The main thing in these jobs was to have enough safety margin. He could have shot the man at forty yards, but he had preferred to get to twenty. And taking the watch and the wallet had been nice touches - pro touches.</p> <p>Pleased with himself, the man heaved his machine off its rest, vaulted smartly into the saddle and kicked down on the starter. Slowly, so as not to show skid marks, he accelerated away back down the road and in a minute or so he was doing seventy again and the wind had redrawn the empty turnip grin across his face.</p> <p>Around the scene of the killing, the forest, which had held its breath while it was done, slowly began to breathe again. James Bond had his first drink of the evening at Fouquet's. It was not a solid drink. One cannot drink seriously in French cafes. Out of doors on a pavement in the sun is no place for vodka or whisky or gin. A fine a 1'eau is fairly serious, but it intoxicates without tasting very good. A quart de champagne or a champagne a I'orange is all right before luncheon, but in the evening one quart leads to another quart and a bottle of indif-ferent champagne is a bad foundation for the night. Pernod is possible, but it should be drunk in company, and anyway Bond had never liked the stuff because its liquorice taste reminded him of his childhood. No, in cafes you have to drink the least offensive of the musical comedy drinks that go with them, and Bond always had the same thing - an Americano - Bitter Campari, Cinzano, a large slice of lemon peel and soda. For the soda he always stipulated Perrier, for in his opinion expensive soda water was the cheapest way to improve a poor drink.</p> <p>When Bond was in Paris he invariably stuck to the same addresses. He stayed at the Terminus Nord, because he liked station hotels and because this was the least pretentious and most anonymous of them. He had luncheon at the Cafe de la Paix, the Rotonde or the Dome, because the food was good enough and it amused him to watch the people. If he wanted a solid drink he had it at Harry's Bar, both because of the solidity of the drinks and because, on his first ignorant visit to Paris at the age of sixteen, he had done what Harry's advertise-ment in the Continental Daily Mail had told him to do and had said to his taxi-driver 'Sank Roo Doe Noo'. That had started one of the memorable evenings of his life, culminating in the loss, almost simultaneous, of his virginity and his notecase. For dinner. Bond went to one of the great restaurants - Vefour, the Caneton, Lucas-Carton or the Cochon d'Or. These he considered, whatever Michelin might say about the Tour d'Argent, Maxims and the like, to have somehow avoided the tarnish of the expense account and the dollar. Anyway, he preferred their cooking. After dinner he generally went to the Place Pigalle to see what would happen to him. When, as usual, nothing did, he would walk home across Paris to the Gare du Nord and go to bed.</p> <p>Tonight Bond decided to tear up this dusty address book and have himself an old-fashioned ball. He was on his way through Paris after a dismally failed assignment on the Austro-Hungarian border. It had been a question of getting a certain Hungarian out. Bond had been sent from London specially to direct the operation over the head of Station V. This had been unpopular with the Vienna Station. There had been misunderstandings - wilful ones. The man had been killed in the frontier minefield. There would have to be a court of inquiry. Bond was due back at his London headquarters on the following day to make his report, and the thought of it all depressed him. Today had been so beautiful -one of those days when you almost believe that Paris is beautiful and gay - and Bond had decided to give the town just one more chance. He would somehow find himself a girl who was a real girl, and he would take her to dinner at some make-believe place in the Bois like the Armenonville. To clean the money-look out of her eyes - for it would certainly be there - he would as soon as possible give her fifty thousand francs. He would say to her: 'I propose to call you Donatienne, or possibly Solange, because these are names that suit my mood and the evening. We knew each other before and you lent me this money becaus...</p></p><h2>Pacific Burn: A Thriller (3) (A Jim Brodie Thriller)</h2><p><i>&#x201c;Pacific Burn</i> is a page-turning, globe-spanning tale of murder, suspense, and intrigue that grabs and holds your attention from beginning to end. Barry Lancet is truly a gifted author, and his character of Jim Brodie is unlike any private investigator you&#x2019;ve ever encountered in literature.&#x201d; &#x2014;Nelson DeMille, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Radiant Angel</i><br> <br>In the third book in &#x201c;what will likely be a long and successful series&#x201d; (<i>San Francisco Magazine</i>), Japanese antiques dealer and PI Jim Brodie goes up against the CIA, FBI, Department of Homeland Security&#x2014;and a killer operating on both sides of the Pacific.<br><br>In recognition for his role in solving the Japantown murders in San Francisco, antiques dealer and sometime-PI Jim Brodie has just been brought on as the liaison for the mayor&#x2019;s new Pacific Rim Friendship Program. Brodie in turn recruits his friend, the renowned Japanese artist Ken Nobuki, and after a promising meeting with city officials and a picture-perfect photo op, Brodie and Nobuki leave City Hall for a waiting limo.<br> <br>But as soon as they exit the building, a sniper attacks them from the roof of the Asian Art Museum. Quick thinking allows Brodie to escape, but Nobuki ends up hospitalized and in a coma. Brodie soon realizes that, with the suspicious and untimely death of Nobuki&#x2019;s oldest son a week earlier in Napa Valley, someone may be targeting his friend&#x2019;s family&#x2014;and killing them off one by one.<br> <br>Suspects are nearly too numerous to name&#x2014;and could be in the United States or anywhere along the Pacific Rim. The quest for answers takes Brodie from his beloved San Francisco to Washington, DC, in a confrontation with the DHS, the CIA, and the FBI; then on to Tokyo, Kyoto, and beyond, in search of what his Japanese sources tell him is a legendary killer in both senses of the word&#x2014;said to be more rumor than real, but deadlier than anything else they&#x2019;ve ever encountered <i>if </i>the whispers are true.</p><p><p><b>Guest Interview: Best-selling Author Steve Berry Talks to Barry Lancet about his award-winning <i>Jim Brodie</i> series</b></p> <p><strong><i>New York Times</i> best seller Steve Berry practiced law for nearly three decades before his first thriller, THE AMBER ROOM, was published in 2003. He wasn&#x2019;t writing legal thrillers or about the law, but instead, his novels had action, history, secrets, and conspiracies. Berry now has over 20 million books in print, in 40 languages and 51 countries, and his latest blockbuster, THE 14TH COLONY is sure to rocket to the top of best-seller lists. In this special guest interview, Berry talks to another writer who had a full career before breaking out with his own exciting international thrillers. </strong></p> <p>I first heard of Barry Lancet when his debut novel, JAPANTOWN, arrived on the scene. The international mystery-thriller leapt onto a number of Best Debut lists and eventually took home the Barry Award for Best First Novel. It also attracted the attention of J. J. Abrams who optioned the series for television. </p> <p>Lancet&#x2019;s follow-up, TOKYO KILL, which also featured the art dealer/PI Jim Brodie, put him in an elite crowd when it was selected as a finalist for the Shamus Award for Best PI Novel of the Year, along with Robert Galbraith (J. K. Rowling) and Reed Farrell Coleman, among others. </p> <p>In his latest effort, PACIFIC BURN, things are looking up for Japan expert Jim Brodie, who also runs an antiques shop in San Francisco. The mayor, impressed by Brodie&#x2019;s success in the Japantown murders, recruits him as the liaison for his new Pacific Rim Friendship Program. Brodie brings a famous Japanese artist friend, Ken Nobuki, on board. But when they are both attacked, Brodie narrowly escapes and his friend ends up in a coma. The story escalates when Brodie is confronted by a task force of CIA, FBI, and Homeland Security agents. When he uncovers a potential plot against Nobuki&#x2019;s family, its origin could be from a number of directions. Disgruntled countries excluded from the mayor&#x2019;s program, political enemies of the mayor, or, most chillingly, Japan&#x2019;s &#x201c;nuclear mafia,&#x201d; the group responsible for a possible cover-up about the meltdown of the power facility at Fukushima. </p> <p>Third time&#x2019;s a charm for this talented author who recently spoke with me about his series, life as a Tokyo expat, and PACIFIC BURN. </p> <p><strong>SB: I get asked this about Cotton Malone a lot, so I&#x2019;ll ask you: What inspired the Jim Brodie series? </strong> </p> <p><strong>BL: </strong>Being hauled down to the stationhouse and interrogated for three-hours by the Tokyo police started me thinking about it. I should have been enraged by their &#x201c;request&#x201d; for a &#x201c;voluntary interview,&#x201d; but I was fascinated by the cat-and-mouse game they played. I thought, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a story here.&#x201d; It percolated for years until I found direction and an overwhelming desire to show others what I&#x2019;d seen during my years in Japan. </p> <p><strong>SB: Wait, wait, wait. You can&#x2019;t just leave us hanging. Why were the Japanese police bothering you in the first place? </strong></p> <p><strong>BL: </strong> Turns out I didn&#x2019;t complete the visa renewal process. I was supposed to inform the local city office when I renewed my visa, but no one told me. My slip-up gave them a chance to grill me. It was about a minor, noncriminal infraction but they could have thrown me out of the country. And believe me, they seemed to want to, asking every question imaginable. </p> <p><strong>SB: What brought you to Tokyo in the first place? And what&#x2019;s kept you there for more than twenty years? </strong></p> <p><strong>BL: </strong> A quick stopover, as I was traveling the globe during my college years, was my first experience. I never imagined that diversion would result in a job, then a marriage, and some great kids. I love the United States, but from my first day in Tokyo, something told me it was going to be my home. </p> <p><strong>SB: Your protagonist, Jim Brodie, is a Japanese art expert, but he lives in the U.S. What made you choose San Francisco as his home instead of Tokyo? </strong></p> <p><strong>BL: </strong> He&#x2019;s a bridge between two worlds, so I wanted him to have a foot in both places. He lives in the U.S., but has to manage his father&#x2019;s PI business in Tokyo. He&#x2019;s the insider who can explain Japan and the Far East to the rest of us&#x2014;as inexplicable events unfold. </p> <p><strong>SB: Besides your encounters with police, how much of what you write about are you familiar with on a personal basis and how much do you have to research? </strong></p> <p><strong>BL: </strong> Most of it is from personal experience and knowledge. I&#x2019;ve been in Japan more than two decades now. I research what I don&#x2019;t know. For PACIFIC BURN, I lived through the disastrous earthquake-tsunami-nuclear plant meltdown, which plays a role in the story. I was 150 miles away from the epicenter and the earthquake shook buildings for five minutes. It shut down all train lines for hours. Some of them for days. The devastation for what is now a ghost town in Fukushima&#x2014;and the corruption uncovered in the wake of the disaster&#x2014;was a story that had to be told. </p> <p><strong>SB: Ah, let&#x2019;s talk more about PACIFIC BURN. Each of your first two books stretched boundaries, as witnessed by the award recognition they received. Where did you and Brodie go in PACIFIC BURN that you haven&#x2019;t gone before? </strong></p> <p><strong>BL: </strong> For the first time, I wove in an actual current event into the plot. A lot of vague and misleading reports were issued from Japanese sources about what happened in Fukushima. People here and in the States were confused about the real story. I was constantly asked about it. There was&#x2014;and still is&#x2014;an alleged cover-up by the so-called &#x201c;nuclear mafia,&#x2019; who figure big in PACIFIC BURN. </p> <p><strong>SB: Like me, you had a full career before your first novel was published. You weren&#x2019;t a lawyer, were you? </strong></p> <p><strong>BL</strong>: No courtrooms for me. I was a book editor for a large publisher based in Tokyo. Everyone in Japan wants a book in English, so I was granted access to a lot of behind-the-scenes areas. Even most Japanese don&#x2019;t get into the places I went. That, plus all the esoteric manuscripts I read, fed my imagination. I&#x2019;ve read that it took you 85 tries before you were first published. I had a similar experience, though not quite that many rejections. Now if I can just follow in your footsteps on the rest of my journey, that would be great. </p>Barry Lancet is a Barry Award�&#x2013;winning author and finalist for the Shamus Award.

His <i>Collected Poems: 1948-1984</i> was published in 1986, and his subsequent works include a book-length poem, <i>Omeros </i>(1990); a collection of verse, <i>The Bounty</i> (1997); and, in an edition illustrated with his own paintings, the long poem <i>Tiepolo's Hound</i> (2000). His numerous plays include <i>The Haitian Trilogy</i> (2001) and <i>Walker and The Ghost Dance</i> (2002). Walcott received the Queen's Medal for Poetry in 1988 and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992.Uneven but filled with passages of startling poetry, this loose trilogy of plays, early work by the future Nobel laureate, is noteworthy more because of who Walcott became than because of its merits. Even in his late teens and twenties, Walcott was ambitious. <i>Henri Christophe</i> recasts the power struggle between the early Haitian leaders Jean Jacques Dessalines and Henri Christophe, both followers of the liberator Toussaint L'Ouverture, as a Shakespearean history play, complete with soliloquies and court intrigues. <i>Drums and Colours</i> daringly packs 400 years of West Indian history into one epic drama; it sprawls too much to be good theater, but on the page, there is something thrilling about a play that starts with Columbus' difficult third voyage to the New World and ends 182 pages later in the nineteenth century. <i>The Haitian Earth</i> is more Brechtian in scope and feeling as it dramatizes in a series of laconic scenes the bloody slave revolt that created the first black-run country in the Western Hemisphere. Throughout the trilogy, Walcott's ear for dialect is remarkable. <i>Jack Helbig</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Morgan Llywelyn, the acclaimed historical writer of books like <i>Lion of Ireland, Bard </i>and <i>The Horse Goddess</i>, is the writer born to bring this epic battle to life. Having created an entire body of work chronicling the Celts and Ireland, she now turns to recent Irish history to create a multivolume saga: <i>The Irish Century.</i><br><br><i>1921 </i>tells the story of the Irish War of Independence and the heartbreaking civil war that followed. Henry Mooney, a reporter for the<i>Clare Champion</i> and the <i>Irish Bulletin</i>, is a self-described "moderate nationalist" who struggles to see the truth in the news of the day, and to report it fairly. Lacking more radical Republican beliefs of his dear friends Ned Halloran and Sile Duffy, Henry reports the political--and later, bloody--actions of his fellow Irishman from the ashes of the failed 1916 Rising to the creation of the Irish Free State to the tragic and wide-ranging battles of the Irish Civil War.<br><br>Meanwhile, Henry feels the impact of these history-changing events in his own personal life. His friendship with Ned falters when their political beliefs diverge, and an unexpected tragedy leaves them further apart than ever. Henry struggles with his passion for a well-bred Protestant Anglo-Irish woman, Ella Rutledge, and as he dutifully reports the events in the political battle for independence, he comes to realize that the Irish struggle for freedom wil leave no life untouched--and no Irish citizen with a dry eye or an untroubled heart.<br></p><p>Since 1980 Morgan Llywelyn has created an entire body of work chronicling the Celts and Ireland, from the earliest times to the present day. her critically acclaimed novels, both of history and of mythology, have been translated into many languages. She is an Irish citizen and lives in Dublin.<br>Llywelyn's second novel in the series she inaugurated with 1916 (1998) furthers her investigation of Irish history by focusing on Ireland's struggle for freedom from Britain. This volume begins in 1917 in the aftermath of the Easter Rising and carries through to the civil war and the establishment of the Republic of Ireland. That Llywelyn knows her Irish history, culture, language and ambience is unquestionable. Unfortunately, in her attempt to amalgamate her encyclopedic knowledge of Ireland with the fictional adventures of Henry Mooney, a journalist torn between the traditional demands of family and personal ambition and his commitment to his country, she produces a story that is as dense as an Irish bog and nearly as confusing to navigate. Henry, a supporter of the Republican cause but a political moderate and neutral observer by nature, moves with alacrity among the various factions, apparently enjoying journalistic immunity as he uses his pen to further the Irish cause and attack the British. As the situation in the country deteriorates, Henry's personal life becomes more complex. Smitten with passionate S�le Halloran, but unable to possess her since she is the wife of his best friend and Easter veteran Ned (protagonist of 1916), Henry falls in love with beautiful Anglo-Irish siren Ella Rutledge, further dividing his loyalties. Often sliding into essayistic prose, with footnotes supplementing the text, the novel depicts events and political developments in exhaustive detail. Though the account of the civil war is thorough and nuanced, readers of 1916 and other popular books by Llywelyn (Lion of Ireland; Bard, etc.) may be taken aback by the historical heft of this offering. (Mar.)Forecasts: Llywelyn is a popular writer and this book won't hurt her sales record, boosted as it will be by an excerpt in the mass market edition of The Last Prince of Ireland (due out March 1), an eight-city author tour, national ad/promo and the availability of a reading group guide (the book is caboosed by 17 pages of source notes and bibliography). <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Christ of faith and the Jesus of history: A critique of Schleiermacher&#39;s Life of Jesus (Lives of Jesus series)</h2><p>Some great books have the capacity to focus on the questions of the day so that everyone must deal with them: others rise to greatness only when they are discovered years later. Strauss&#39;s THE CHRIST OF FAITH AND THE JESUS OF HISTORY may belong to both groups. When it was first published, it articulated sharply the crucial issues in the then current theological debate. Theologians today are discovering, not least of all from this century old &#34;book review&#34; here translated for the first time, that they are not yet finished with David Friedrich Strauss. THE CHRIST OF FAITH AND THE JESUS OF HISTORY brings to a head issues which had dominated Strauss&#39;s theological work. When read in the light of the author&#39;s career, amply surveyed in the Editor&#39;s Introduction, it also illumines major issues of modern Christian theology; the character of the Gospels, the historical accuracy of what they report, the possibility of getting at &#34;Jesus as he really was,&#34; and the relevance of such a Jesus for modern man.

Yet all his life he was dogged by chronic ill-health and cursed with a masochistic psychological make-up that meant he could never attain the satisfaction in personal relationships he craved. Although the butt of ridicule from his cousin Vita Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf and the model for Nancy Mitford&#39;s comic fictional character &#34;Uncle Davey&#34; in &#34;The Pursuit of Love&#34;, Eddy Sackville-West is seen by the author as, in reality, a man of physical courage and moral stature. He was the translator of Rilke and one of the first to recognize the genius of Kafka, he also befriended, long before they were famous, Graham Sutherland, Michael Tippett and Benjamin Britten, with whom he fell in love. For this biography, Michael De-la-Noy has gathered information from his diaries and many unpublished letters - from Evelyn Waugh, Alix Strachey, Duncan Grant and Raymond Mortimer - to relate the story of Edward&#39;s life, which is set against the literary, musical and social history of Britain between the 1920s and 1960s.

One Roman noted that "everything in the mountains is frozen solid," while St. Ambrose, after seeing his first glacier, feared that the world would end by being suffocated in ice; heeding them, voyagers took the long way around whenever they could.<p> All that changed in the 1800s, writes Fergus Fleming in this highly entertaining chronicle, when travelers under the spell of Enlightenment philosophers and Romantic poets came to the Alps looking for a hint of heaven on earth. Those who, for many reasons, wanted to get a little closer to the deity attempted the first recreational climbs of the mountains. They were an odd lot, indeed. One was Albert Smith, who burdened his porters with wheels of cheese and casks of wine, made his way up Mont Blanc, had a feast, and turned his adventures into a stage play that wowed London audiences throughout the 1850s. Another was the natural scientist John Tyndall, who regarded the Alps as the devil's work but nonetheless raced against his compatriot Edward Whymper to climb the Matterhorn. Still another was William Coolidge, an American-born Oxford don who made Whymper's already unhappy life just a little less pleasant.</p><p> Fleming writes winningly of their "conquest" of the mountains--which, of course, has not kept succeeding generations from attempting new routes up the Alps with every climbing season. Mountaineering buffs and armchair travelers alike will enjoy his account. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Fergus Fleming is a freelance writer living in London W8 and Gloucestershire.

But Jocasta Nu, librarian of the Jedi Temple, is making a desperate effort to gather and preserve whatever she can of the religion's legacy. Palpatine views her as a particular threat to the Empire - does her knowledge make her a one-woman Jedi Order?<br></p><p></p><h2>The company we keep: An ethics of fiction</h2><p>In <i>The Company We Keep</i>, Wayne C. Booth argues for the relocation of ethics to the center of our engagement with literature.<br>But the questions he asks are not confined to morality. Returning ethics to its root sense, Booth proposes that the ethical critic will be interested in any effect on the ethos, the total character or quality of tellers and listeners. Ethical criticism will risk talking about the quality of <i>this</i> particular encounter with <i>this</i> particular work. Yet it will give up the old hope for definitive judgments of "good" work and "bad." Rather it will be a conversation about <i>many</i> kinds of personal and social goods that fictions can serve or destroy. While not ignoring the consequences for conduct of engaging with powerful stories, it will attend to that more immediate topic, What happens to us <i>as we read</i>? Who am I, <i>during the hours of reading or listening</i>? What is the quality of the life I lead in the company of these would-be friends?<br>Through a wide variety of periods and genres and scores of particular works, Booth pursues various metaphors for such engagements: "friendship with books," "the exchange of gifts," "the colonizing of worlds," "the constitution of commonwealths." He concludes with extended explorations of the ethical powers and potential dangers of works by Rabelais, D. H. Lawrence, Jane Austen, and Mark Twain.</p><p><b>Wayne C. Booth</b> (1921-2005) was George M. Pullman Distinguished Service Professor of English at the University of Chicago.Building on the Aristotelianism of his The Rhetoric of Fiction (1961) and the critical pluralism of his Critical Understanding ( LJ 6/1/79), Booth argues that fictional characters provide alternatives for the social roles we play. In some stories we find virtuous examples of behavior, in others reprehensible ones. Readers discover the difference through "coduction," that is, evaluative conversation. Booth's project has limitations, such as his reliance on a form of social psychology that he inadequately defines. Still, he frankly discusses Rabelais's sexism and Twain's racism, and he eschews mystifying and seducing jargon.

Keenan, and the court at the Tokyo War Crimes Trials believed him. As a result, Japanese officers and soldiers who conducted beheading demonstrations, engaged in unethical medical experiments, or even practiced cannibalism on POWs, were found guilty of the more prosecutable charge of murder. In the years since the Japanese war crimes trials concluded, the proceedings have been colored by charges of racism, vengeance, and guilt. <p>Tim Maga contends that despite these charges, the trials encompassed some of the most fascinating criminal cases of the twentieth century. Judgment at Tokyo is a bold reassessment of the trials, in which defendants ranged from lowly Japanese Imperial Army privates to former prime ministers. Maga shows that these were cases in which good law was practiced and that they changed the ways war crimes trials are approached today. </p><p>In contrast to Nuremberg, the efforts in Tokyo, Guam, and other locations throughout the Pacific received little attention by the Western press. Once the Cold War began and America needed Pacific allies, the atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers throughout the 1930s and early 1940s were rarely mentioned. The trials were dismissed as phony justice and &#x201c;Japan Bashing.&#x201d; </p><p>Since the defendants did not represent a government for which genocide was a policy pursuit, their cases were more difficult to prosecute than those of Nazi war criminals. Keenan and his compatriots adopted criminal court tactics and established precedents in the conduct of war crimes trials that still stand today. Maga reviews the context for the trials, recounts the proceedings, and concludes that they were, in fact, decent examples of American justice and fair play.</p></p><p>Tim Maga, Oglesby Professor of American Heritage at Bradley University and a former coordinator in the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, is the author of several books, including Hands Across the Sea? U.S.-Japan Relations, 1961-1981.Between 1946 and 1948, a large segment of Japan's wartime military and civilian leadership was tried for war crimes. The trials never received the publicity of the Nuremberg trials. Although the Nuremberg trials have generally been immune from reproach by historians, the Tokyo trials have frequently been criticized as "racist," "hypocritical," or an example of "victor's justice." The fact that Emperor Hirohito was granted de facto immunity enhanced the impression of unfairness. Maga, a professor of American heritage at Bradley University, has previously written extensively on U.S.-Japanese relations. He convincingly asserts that the Tokyo trials must be viewed separately from Nuremberg, since there were no accusations at Tokyo of a calculated plot of genocide. Given the limitations imposed by that fact, Maga believes that the trials were warranted and generally conducted fairly. Furthermore, the Tokyo trials set important precedents in establishing what factors constitute war crimes and how they can be effectively prosecuted. This is a provocative and timely work. <i>Jay Freeman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Journalist William Buehler Seabrook was emblematic of this trend&#x2015;participating in voodoo ceremonies, riding camels cross the Sahara desert, communing with cannibals and most notably, popularizing the term &#x201c;zombie&#x201d; in the West. A string of his bestselling books show an engaged, sympathetic gentleman hoping to share these strange, hidden delights with the rest of the world. He was willing to go deeper than any outsider had before. But, of course, there was a dark side. Seabrook was a barely functioning alcoholic who was deeply obsessed with bondage and the so-called mystical properties of pain and degradation. His life was a series of traveling highs and drunken lows; climbing on and falling off the wagon again and again. What led the popular and vivid writer to such a sad state? </p><p>Cartoonist Joe Ollmann spent seven years researching Seabrook&#x2019;s life, interviewing surviving family and accessing long neglected archives, in order to piece together the peripatetic life of a forgotten American writer. Often weaving in Seabrook&#x2019;s own words and those of his biographers, Ollmann&#x2019;s<i> The Abominable Mr. Seabrook</i> posits Seabrook the believer versus Seabrook the exploiter, and leaves the reader to consider where one ends and the other begins.</p></p><p><b>Joe Ollmann</b> lives in Hamilton, Ontario with his wife and child.

A military junta had seized power, and the widespread feeling of unrest that had been brewing for years among the Haitian peasantry and the urban poor came to a boil, resulting in chaos: mass strikes, riots and other forms of violence. Wilentz's first book carefully, sensitively narrates these events in the first person, providing historical background when necessary, and telling the stories of Haitians from all walks of life, from the infamous "Tontons Macoute"--a ruthless government-sponsored vigilante group--to voodoo priests (who speak at length of their magic), and including government officials, missionaries, intellectuals, workers and the unemployed. The former Time reporter's numerous visits to the island between 1986 and 1988 enrich her account with details of daily life, both in the dilapidated alleys and slums of Port-au-Prince and in remote villages tucked away in lush tropical mountains.

Do we have an instinct for compassion? Or are we, as is often assumed, only on earth to serve our own survival and interests? In this thought-provoking book, the acclaimed author of <i>Our Inner Ape</i> examines how empathy comes naturally to a great variety of animals, including humans. <br><br>By studying social behaviors in animals, such as bonding, the herd instinct, the forming of trusting alliances, expressions of consolation, and conflict resolution, Frans de Waal demonstrates that animals&#x2013;and humans&#x2013;are "preprogrammed to reach out." He has found that chimpanzees care for mates that are wounded by leopards, elephants offer "reassuring rumbles" to youngsters in distress, and dolphins support sick companions near the water's surface to prevent them from drowning. From day one humans have innate sensitivities to faces, bodies, and voices; we've been designed to feel for one another.<br><br>De Waal's theory runs counter to the assumption that humans are inherently selfish, which can be seen in the fields of politics, law, and finance, and whichseems to be evidenced by the current greed-driven stock market collapse. But he cites the public's outrage at the U.S. government's lack of empathy in the wake of Hurricane Katrina as a significant shift in perspective&#x2013;one that helped Barack Obama become elected and ushered in what may well become an Age of Empathy. Through a better understanding of empathy's survival value in evolution, de Waal suggests, we can work together toward a more just society based on a more generous and accurate view of human nature.<br><br>Written in layman's prose with a wealth of anecdotes, wry humor, and incisive intelligence, <i>The Age of Empathy</i> is essential reading for our embattled times.</p><p>FRANS DE WAAL is a Dutch-born biologist who lives and works in Atlanta, Georgia. One of the world's best-known primatologists, de Waal is C. H. Candler professor of psychology and director of the Living Links Center at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University. He has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences and the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences. In 2007, <i>Time</i> selected him as one of the World's 100 Most Influential People.1<br><br>Biology, Left and Right<br><br>What is government itself but the greatest of all<br><br>reflections on human nature?<br><br>-james madison, 1788<br><br>Are we our brothers' keepers? Should we be? Or would this role only interfere with why we are on earth, which according to economists is to consume and produce, and according to biologists is to survive and reproduce? That both views sound similar is logical given that they arose at around the same time, in the same place, during the English Industrial Revolution. Both follow a competition-is-good-for-you logic.<br><br>Slightly earlier and slightly to the north, in Scotland, the thinking was different. The father of economics, Adam Smith, understood as no other that the pursuit of self-interest needs to be tempered by "fellow feeling." He said so in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, a book not nearly as popular as his later work The Wealth of Nations. He famously opened his first book with:<br><br>How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.<br><br>The French revolutionaries chanted of fraternite, Abraham Lincoln appealed to the bonds of sympathy, and Theodore Roosevelt spoke glowingly of fellow feeling as "the most important factor in producing a healthy political and social life." But if this is true, why is this sentiment sometimes ridiculed as being, well, sentimental? A recent example occurred after Hurricane Katrina struck Louisiana in 2005. While the American people were transfixed by the unprecedented catastrophe, one cable news network saw fit to ask if the Constitution actually provides for disaster relief. A guest on the show argued that the misery of others is none of our business.<br><br>The day the levees broke, I happened to be driving down from Atlanta to Alabama to give a lecture at Auburn University. Except for a few fallen trees, this part of Alabama had suffered little damage, but the hotel was full of refugees: people had crammed the rooms with grandparents, children, dogs, and cats. I woke up at a zoo! Not the strangest place for a biologist, perhaps, but it conveyed the size of the calamity. And these people were the lucky ones. The morning newspaper at my door screamed, "Why have we been left behind like animals?" a quote from one of the people stuck for days without food and sanitation in the Louisiana Superdome.<br><br>I took issue with this headline, not because I felt there was nothing to complain about, but because animals don't necessarily leave one another behind. My lecture was on precisely this topic, on how we have an "inner ape" that is not nearly as callous and nasty as advertised, and how empathy comes naturally to our species. I wasn't claiming that it always finds expression, though. Thousands of people with money and cars had fled New Orleans, leaving the sick, old, and poor to fend for themselves. In some places dead bodies floated in the water, where they were being eaten by alligators.<br><br>But immediately following the disaster there was also deep embarrassment in the nation about what had happened, and an incredible outpouring of support. Sympathy was not absent-it just was late in coming. Americans are a generous people, yet raised with the mistaken belief that the "invisible hand" of the free market-a metaphor introduced by the same Adam Smith-will take care of society's woes. The invisible hand, however, did nothing to prevent the appalling survival-of-the-fittest scenes in New Orleans.<br><br>The ugly secret of economic success is that it sometimes comes at the expense of public funding, thus creating a giant underclass that no one cares about. Katrina exposed the underbelly of American society. On my drive back to Atlanta, it occurred to me that this is the theme of our time: the common good. We tend to focus on wars, terror threats, globalization, and petty political scandals, yet the larger issue is how to combine a thriving economy with a humane society. It relates to health care, education, justice, and-as illustrated by Katrina-protection against nature. The levees in Louisiana had been criminally neglected. In the weeks following the flooding, the media were busy finger-pointing. Had the engineers been at fault? Had funds been diverted? Shouldn't the president have broken off his vacation? Where I come from, fingers belong in the dike-or at least that's how legend has it. In the Netherlands, much of which lies up to twenty feet below sea level, dikes are so sacred that politicians have literally no say over them: Water management is in the hands of engineers and local citizen boards that predate the nation itself.<br><br>Come to think of it, this also reflects a distrust of government, not so much big government but rather the short-sightedness of most politicians.<br><br>Evolutionary Spirit<br><br>How people organize their societies may not seem the sort of topic a biologist should worry about. I should be concerned with the ivory-billed woodpecker, the role of primates in the spread of AIDS or Ebola, the disappearance of tropical rain forests, or whether we evolved from the apes. Whereas the latter remains an issue for some, there has nevertheless been a dramatic shift in public opinion regarding the role of biology. The days are behind us when E. O. Wilson was showered with cold water after a lecture on the connection between animal and human behavior. Greater openness to parallels with animals makes life easier for the biologist, hence my decision to go to the next level and see if biology can shed light on human society. If this means wading right into political controversy, so be it; it's not as if biology is not already a part of it. Every debate about society and government makes huge assumptions about human nature, which are presented as if they come straight out of biology. But they almost never do.<br><br>Lovers of open competition, for example, often invoke evolution. The e-word even slipped into the infamous "greed speech" of Gordon Gekko, the ruthless corporate raider played by Michael Douglas in the 1987 movie Wall Street:<br><br>The point is, ladies and gentleman, that "greed"-for lack of a better word-is good. Greed is right. Greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.<br><br>The evolutionary spirit? Why are assumptions about biology always on the negative side? In the social sciences, human nature is typified by the old Hobbesian proverb Homo homini lupus ("Man is wolf to man"), a questionable statement about our own species based on false assumptions about another species. A biologist exploring the interaction between society and human nature really isn't doing anything new, therefore. The only difference is that instead of trying to justify a particular ideological framework, the biologist has an actual interest in the question of what human nature is and where it came from. Is the evolutionary spirit really all about greed, as Gekko claimed, or is there more to it?<br><br>Students of law, economics, and politics lack the tools to look at their own society with any objectivity. What are they going to compare it with? They rarely, if ever, consult the vast knowledge of human behavior accumulated in anthropology, psychology, biology, or neuroscience. The short answer derived from the latter disciplines is that we are group animals: highly cooperative, sensitive to injustice, sometimes warmongering, but mostly peace loving. A society that ignores these tendencies can't be optimal. True, we are also incentive-driven animals, focused on status, territory, and food security, so that any society that ignores those tendencies can't be optimal, either. There is both a social and a selfish side to our species. But since the latter is, at least in the West, the dominant assumption, my focus will be on the former: the role of empathy and social connectedness.<br><br>There is exciting new research about the origins of altruism and fairness in both ourselves and other animals. For example, if one gives two monkeys hugely different rewards for the same task, the one who gets the short end of the stick simply refuses to perform. In our own species, too, individuals reject income if they feel the distribution is unfair. Since any income should beat none at all, this means that both monkeys and people fail to follow the profit principle to the letter. By protesting against unfairness, their behavior supports both the claim that incentives matter and that there is a natural dislike of injustice.<br><br>Yet in some ways we seem to be moving ever closer to a society with no solidarity whatsoever, one in which a lot of people can expect the short end of the stick. To reconcile this trend with good old Christian values, such as care for the sick and poor, may seem hopeless. But one common strategy is to point the finger at the victims. If the poor can be blamed for being poor, everyone else is off the hook. Thus, a year after Katrina, Newt Gingrich, a prominent conservative politician, called for an investigation into "the failure of citizenship" of people who had been unsuccessful escaping from the hurricane.<br><br>Those who highlight individual freedom often regard collective interests as a romantic notion, something for sissies and communists. They prefer an every-man-for-himself logic. For example, instead of spending money on levees that protect an entire region, why not let everyone take care of their own safety? A new company in Florida is doing just that, renting out seats on private jets to fly people out of places threatened by hurricanes. This way, those who can afford it won't need to drive out at five miles per hour with the rest of the populace.<br><br>Every society has to deal with this me-first attitude. I see it play out every day. And here I am not referring to people, but to chimpanzees at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, where I work. At our field station northe...</p><h2>The Visual Dictionary of Interior Architecture and Design (Visual Dictionaries)</h2><p><p><i>The Visual Dictionary of Interior Architecture and Design</i> is a comprehensive guide to the numerous terms associated with, and used within, the fields of interior architecture and design.</p><p>Over 250 terms are explained and contextualised, with concise definitions accompanied by illustrations and examples taken from traditional and contemporary interior architecture.</p><p>The dictionary covers traditional terms still in current usage as well as modern terminology such as hyper-reality and sustainability.

Not on your life. She&#39;s back, with her other favorite hobby--cooking delicious meals. And she&#39;s just as &#34;quotable&#34; as ever: &#34;If the hostess is all a-flutter like a butterfly caught in a net--then, as the Irish say, &#39;I wish I was to home and the party was to hell.&#39;&#34; Don&#39;t serve guests&#39; dishes &#34;you haven&#39;t made successfully two or three times--and quite lately.&#34; And after supper, &#34;Leave the dishes on the table, blow out the candles, shut the door and serve finger desserts and coffee in another room . . . do not let your guests help you clean up!&#34; In addition to advice, Mrs. Whaley has opened her personal scrapbook of receipts and selected one hundred of her favorites, including regional delectables like &#34;Edisto Shrimp Pie,&#34; great dinner dishes like &#34;Louisa Hagood&#39;s Ginger Chicken&#34; and &#34;Miss Em&#39;s Pork Tenderloin,&#34; old-fashioned breakfast breads like &#34;Nan&#39;s Little Thin Corn Cakes,&#34; and true discoveries like &#34;Dancing School Fudge.&#34; Just as he did in their first acclaimed, best-selling collaboration, novelist William Baldwin perfectly captures the octogenarian cadence: &#34;Inviting people to break bread with me challenges my skills at cooking and fielding a congenial gathering of people. And I love a challenge.&#34;</p><p>Charleston, that slightly starchy though gracious Southern city, seems an unlikely place to have made a heroine of the decidedly unstarchy Emily Whaley. Yet Mrs. Whaley's remarkable garden was a standard stop for many years on the Historic Charleston Foundation's annual garden tour, and Mrs. Whaley (who, despite her gregarious informality, had impeccable Southern bloodlines) was a popular social fixture, having founded the Cotillion, the city's most upscale dancing school. Entertaining was Mrs. Whaley's second-favorite hobby, and <i>Mrs. Whaley Entertains</i> is a slim, delightful collection of family anecdotes and timeless Southern recipes, salted liberally with Mrs. W.'s strong opinions ("Never serve anything to a guest that you haven't made successfully two or three times and made quite totally yours") and abundant good humor ("A good hostess simply wants you to enjoy yourself and won't care a whit if you refuse something as ungodly looking as an oyster"). Emily Whaley died in June 1998; this pleasant guide to Southern hospitality is a fitting memorial. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i>Dig right in to the plucky octogenarian Emily Whaley and her passionate, endlessly quotable opinions on gardening and just about everything else." said The New York Times Book Review when Mrs. Whaley and Her Charleston Garden came out in spring 1997. Emily Whaley took the gardening world by storm--and a few other worlds as well.<p> It turns out Mrs. Whaley, at eighty-seven, had a good deal more on her mind that she had no intention of keeping to herself. Her other favorite hobby--cooking delicious meals and serving them to the people she loved--was ripe for the picking and her opinions on fostering friendship and love as quotable as ever: "What experience has taught me is that people consider it a special compliment to be invited to a meal. <i>But</i> if the hostess is all aflutter like a butterfly caught in a net, then as the Irish say, "I wish I was to home and the party was to hell!"</p><p> So, here are all the admonishments of Mrs. Whaley passed along to generations of Charleston hosts and hostesses. Such as "Don't serve guests dishes you haven't made successfully two or three times--and quite lately." And after supper, "leave the dishes on the table, blow out the candles, shut the door and serve finger desserts and coffee in another room...do not let your supper guests help you clean up!"</p><p> Here, as well, are her favorite on hundred recipes--regional delectables like "Edisto Breakfast Shrimp," perfect summer party dishes like "Pawleys Island Crab Cakes," fine old-fashioned breads like "Little Thin Cornmeal Pancakes," her variations on old standbys like "Dancing School Fudge," and the recipes painstakingly collected for dealing with what the fisherman and hunter might bring home. Sprinkled throughout are more of her juicy little family stories and her priceless explanations of Southern parlance. For example: "We call it grits when it's in the box at the grocery and these same grits are called hominy when we have cooked it for an hour."</p><p> Just as he did in their first collaboration, William Baldwin perfectly captures the Whaley cadence and positive spirit: "I've got to admit that eighty-seven doesn't figure out as middle age. All right, I'm no longer middle-aged anymore. But this categorizing of where old age starts and what it looks like should be kicked overboard.</p><p> Mrs. Whaley Entertains indeed.</p></p><h2>Nosey Mrs. Rat (Picture Puffins)</h2><p>Mrs. Rat makes a career out of spying on her neighbors, but the tables are unexpectedly turned on her.</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 2 " 'I love to know what's going on,' said Shirley. 'I don't get paid for itit's my hobby.' " But the other people in town think Mrs. Rat is a snoop and resent her continual unwanted advice. Finally, the nosey Mrs. Rat tattles on Brewster Blackstone once too often, and he decides to retaliate. Marshall's watercolor and ink illustrations are typically humorous, colorful and well-suited to the story. Brewster's revenge is a bit cruel, but children will enjoy the antics of Mrs. Rat as she goes to greater and greater lengths to snoop, and they will find the illustrations amusing.

Now, as I shivered beside the cenotaph, knowing death was coming, what I felt was very different.<br><br>Only knowing it was too late to stop what was about to happen kept me from screaming a warning as I clutched the cold marble.<br><br>"Did you bring the money?" the first man asked, his voice tight with an anxiety that strummed through the air. He wore dress slacks an inch too long, hems pooling around scuffed department store loafers. His old leather jacket was done up against the bitter March night, but misbuttoned. I could picture his fingers trembling as he'd hurried out to this midnight meeting.<br><br>The other man was a decade older, his jogging suit hood pulled tight around his red-cheeked face. Beside him, a Chow panted, the chuff-chuff filling the silence, black tongue lolling as the dog strained the confines of its short leash.<br><br>"Did you bring the money?" the younger man asked again as he glanced around the park, his anxiety sharp against the cold rage blowing off the other man.<br><br>"Did you really think I'd pay?"<br><br>The older man lunged. A blast of fear, so intense my eyelids quivered. Then a gasp, rich with shock and pain. Chaos rolled over me and moonlight sparked red against the knife blade. The stink of voided bowels filled the air as the younger man staggered back into a spindly maple. He tottered for a moment, propped against it, then slumped at its base.<br><br>The killer pulled his dog closer. The Chow danced, its chaos fluttering past me, confusion warring with hunger. The man shoved its head to the wound, steaming blood pumping. The dog took a tentative lick, then-<br><br>The vision broke and I reeled, grabbing the cenotaph. A moment's pause, eyes squeezed shut. Then I straightened and blinked against the bright morning sun.<br><br>At the foot of the cenotaph, a shrine had started, with plucked daffodils and scraps of paper scrawled with "We'll Miss You, Brian" and "Rest in Peace, Ryan." Anyone who knew Bryan Mills well enough to spell his name was still at home, in shock. The people hugging and sobbing around the shrine were only hoping to catch the eye of a roving TV camera, say a few words about what a great guy "Ryan" had been.<br><br>As I circled the crime scene tape, I passed the fake mourners, and their sobbing rose . . . until they noticed I wasn't carrying a camera, and fell back to sipping steaming coffees and huddling against the icy morning.<br><br>They might not have made me for a reporter, but the closest cop guarding the scene did, his glower telling me not to bother asking for a statement. I'm sure "Hey, I know what happened to your dead guy" would have been a guaranteed conversation opener. But then what would I say?<br><br>"How do I know? Um, I had a vision. Psychic? No. I can only see the past-a talent I inherited from my father. More of a curse, really, though I'm sure he thinks otherwise. Maybe you've heard of him? Lucifer? No, not Satan-that's a whole different guy. I'm what they call a half-demon, a human fathered by a demon. Most of us get a special power, like fire, telekinesis or teleportation, without a demon's need for chaos. But that chaos hunger is all I get, plus a few special powers to help me find it. Like visions of past trauma, which is why I know how your victim died. And I can read chaotic thoughts, like the one going through your head right now, Officer. You're wondering whether you should quietly call for the ambulance or pin me to the ground first, in case my psychotic break turns violent."<br><br>So I stuck to my job: reporting the news, not becoming it. I found a likely target-the youngest officer, buttons gleaming, gaze following the news cameras, shoulders straightening each time one promised to swing his way, then slumping when it moved elsewhere.<br><br>As I approached, his gaze traveled over me and his chin lifted to showcase a square jaw. A smile tweaked his lips. When I took out my notebook, the smile ignited, and he stepped forward to intercept me, lest I change my mind.<br><br>"Hello, there," he said. "I haven't seen you before. New at the Gazette?"<br><br>I shook my head. "I'm national."<br><br>His eyes glittered, envisioning his name in Time or USA Today. I always felt a little bad about that. True News was a national publication, though . . . a national supermarket tabloid.<br><br>"Hope Adams," I said, thrusting out my hand.<br><br>"Adams?"<br><br>"That's right."<br><br>A flush bloomed on his cheeks. "Sorry, I, uh, wasn't sure I heard that right."<br><br>Apparently, I didn't look like this officer's idea of a "Hope Adams." My mother had been a student from India when she met my dad at college. Will Adams, though, was not my biological father, and half-demons inherit their appearance from their maternal DNA.<br><br>As I chatted him up, a man lurched from behind the cenotaph. He peered around, his eyes wild behind green-lensed glasses. Spying us, he strode over, one black-nailed finger jabbing.<br><br>"You took him, didn't you?"<br><br>The officer's hand slid to his belt. "Sir, you need to step back-"<br><br>"Or what?" The man stopped inches from the officer, swaying. "You'll shoot me? Like you shot him? Take me away too? Study me? Dissect me? Then deny everything?"<br><br>"If you mean the victim-"<br><br>"I meant the werewolf."<br><br>The officer cleared his throat. "There, uh, was no werewolf, sir. The victim was-"<br><br>"Eaten!" The man leaned forward, spittle flying. "Torn apart and eaten! Tracks everywhere. You can't cover it up this time."<br><br>"A werewolf?" said a woman, sidling over as she passed. "I heard that too."<br><br>The officer slid a small "can you believe this?" smile my way. I struggled to return it. I could believe that people thought this was a werewolf; that's why True News had sent their "weird tales girl" to cover the story. As for werewolves themselves, I certainly believed in them-though even before the vision I'd known this wasn't one of their kills.<br><br>"Sorry about that," the officer said when he'd finally moved the conspiracy theorist on.<br>"Werewolves? Dare I even ask where that rumor came from?"<br><br>"The kids who found the body got all freaked out, seeing dog tracks around it, and they started posting online about werewolves. I have no idea how the dog got involved."<br><br>I was already mentally writing my story. "When asked about the werewolf rumors, an officer on the site admitted he couldn't explain the combined signs of canine and human." That's the trick of writing for a tabloid. You take the facts and massage them, hinting, implying, suggesting . . . As long as no one is humiliated unfairly, and no sources are named, I don't have a problem giving readers the entertainment they want.<br><br>Karl would have found it entertaining too. If I'd been assigned this story a couple of months ago, I'd have been waiting for his next call, so I could say, "Hey, I got a werewolf story. Can I get a statement?" He'd make some sardonic comment, and I'd curl up, settling in for a long talk, telling myself it was just friendship, that I'd never be fool enough to fall for Karl Marsten. Kidding myself, of course. The moment I let him cross that line past friendship, I got burned . . . and it was just as bad as I'd always feared.<br><br>I pushed memories of Karl aside and concentrated on the story. The officer had just let slip a lead on the kids who'd found the body-two girls who worked at the 7-Eleven on the corner-when clouds suddenly darkened the day to twilight. Thunder boomed, and I dropped my pen. As the officer bent to grab it, I snuck a glance around. No one was looking at the sky or running for cover. They were all carrying on as they had been.<br><br>The officer kept talking, but I could barely hear him through the thunderclaps. I gritted my teeth and waited for the vision to end. A storm moving in? Possible, if it promised enough destruction to qualify as chaotic. But I suspected the source was a Tempestras-a "storm" half-demon. One offshoot of my "gift" was the ability to sense other supernaturals through their chaotic powers.<br><br>I cast another surreptitious glance around. My gaze settled instead on the one person I hadn't noticed before. A dark-haired man, at least six foot three, with a linebacker's body ill-concealed by a custom-tailored suit.<br><br>He seemed to be looking my way, but with his dark sunglasses it was impossible to tell. Then he lowered them, pale blue eyes meeting mine, chin dipping in greeting. He walked over.<br><br>"Ms. Adams? A word please?" <br><i><br>Hope<br>Godfather</i><br><br> I checked for chaos vibes and felt nothing. Still, any time a hulking half-demon stranger sought me out hundreds of miles from my home, I had reason to be alarmed.<br><br>"Let's head over there."<br><br>He nodded to a quiet corner under an elm. When we stopped, he shivered and looked up into the dense branches.<br><br>"Not the warmest spot," he said. "I guess that's why it's the one empty corner in the park. No sunshine."<br><br>"But you could fix that."<br><br>I braced myself for a denial. Instead I got a grin that thawed his ice-blue eyes.<br><br>"Now that's a handy talent. I could use that in my line of work."<br><br>"And that would be?"<br><br>"Troy Morgan," he said, as if in answer. "My boss would like to talk to you."<br><br>The name clicked-Benicio Cortez's personal bodyguard.<br><br>I followed Troy's gaze to a vehicle idling fifty feet away. A white SUV with Cadillac emblems on the wheels. Beside it stood a dark-haired man who could pass for Troy's twin. If both of Benicio Cortez's bodyguards were here, there was no doubt who sat behind those tinted windows.<br><br>My hastily eaten breakfast sank into the pit of my stomach.<br><br>"If it's about this-" I waved at the crime scene, "-you can tell Mr. Cortez it wasn't a werewolf, so . . ." I trailed off, seeing his expression. "It isn't about the werewolf rumor, is it?"<br><br>Troy shook his head. Why else would Benicio Cortez fly from Miami to speak to a half-demon nobody? Because I owed him. The bagel turned to lead.<br><br>"Okay," I said, lifting my notebook. "I'm in the middle of a story right now, but I could meet him in an hour, say . . ." I scanned the street for a coffee shop.<br><br>"He needs to talk to you now."<br><br>Troy's voice was soft, gentle even, but a steel edge in his tone told me I didn't have a choice. Benicio Cortez wanted to talk to me, and it was Troy's job to make that happen.<br><br>I glanced at the crime scene. "Can I just get a few more minutes? If I can talk to one more witness, I'll have enough for a story-"<br><br>"Mr. Cortez will look after that."<br><br>He touched my elbow, gaze settling on mine, sympathetic but firm. When I still resisted, he leaned down, voice lowering. "He'd like to speak to you in the car, but if you'd be more comfortable in a public place, I can arrange it."<br><br>I shook my head, shoved my notebook into my pocket and motioned for him to lead the way.<br><br>As I moved toward the curb, a passing car hit a patch of melting snow, throwing up a sheet of slush. I scampered back, but it caught my legs, dappling my skirt and nylons, the icy pellets sliding down and coming to rest in my shoes. So much for looking presentable.<br><br>I rubbed my arms and told myself the goose bumps were from the ice, not trepidation over meeting Benicio Cortez. I'm a society girl-meeting a CEO shouldn't be any cause for nerves. But Cortez Corporation was no ordinary Fortune 500 company.<br><br>A Cabal looked like a regular multinational corporation, but it was owned and staffed by supernaturals, and the unique abilities of its employees gave it a massive advantage over its competitors. It used that edge for everything from the legitimate (sorcerer spells to protect their vaults) to the unethical (astral-projecting shamans conducting corporate espionage) to the despicable (a teleporting half-demon assassin murdering a business rival).<br><br>I'd spent two years working for the Cortez Cabal. Unintentionally. Hired by Tristan Robard, who I thought was a representative of the interracial council, I'd been placed with True News to keep an eye on supernatural stories, suppressing or downplaying the real ones and alerting the council to potential trouble. My job soon expanded to helping them locate rogue supernaturals.<br><br>It had been the perfect way to guiltlessly indulge my hunger for chaos. The phrase "too good to be true" comes to mind, but I'd been in such a dark place-depressed, angry, confused. When you're that far down and someone offers you a hand back up, you grab it and you don't ask questions.<br>Then came my toughest assignment. Capturing a werewolf jewel thief during a museum gala. I'd been so pleased with myself . . . until that werewolf-Karl Marsten-ripped the rose-colored glasses from my eyes and proved that I was really working for the Cortez Cabal. When we escaped that mess, cleaning services came from an unexpected quarter: Benicio. My employment had been a secret operation of Tristan's, and his attack on Karl a personal matter, so in apology, Benicio had disposed of the bodies and provided medical assistance for Karl.<br><br>In return, we owed him. Until now, I'd never worried about that because I had a codebtor. Karl was a professional thief-capable of guiding me through whatever underworld task Benicio set us.<br>But now Benicio had come to collect, and Karl wasn't around to do anything about it.<br><br>My skirt gave an obscene squeak as I slid onto the SUV's leather seat. If the man within noticed, he gave no sign, just put out a hand to help me.<br><br>As the door closed, the roar of morning traffic vanished, replaced by the murmur of calypso jazz, so soft I had to strain to recognize it. Gone too were the exhaust fumes, making way for the stench of stale smoke. <br><br>"Cigar," the man said, catching my nose wrinkling. "Cuban, though the expense doesn't make the smell any better. I requested a nonsmoking vehicle, but with high-end rentals, people think if they pay enough, they can do as they please."<br><br>Benicio Cortez. He bore little resemblance to the one Cortez I knew-his youngest son, Lucas. Benicio was at least sixty, probably no more than five eight, broad-faced and stocky. Only his eyes reminded me of his son-nice eyes, big and dark. The kind of guy you'd let hold your purse or take your son into the bathroom. Bet that came in handy when he was telling you he understood why you didn't want to sell your three-generation family business . . . while text-messaging a fire half-demon to torch the place before you got back from lunch.</p><h2>1, 2 Kings (Word Biblical Themes)</h2><p>In the companion volumes to 1 and 2 Kings in the Word Biblical Commentary, Simon DeVries and T.

When one of his novels came to the attention of Bethany House Publishers, his status as an unpublished novelist changed. His first book, <i>The Presence, </i>was published in 1990 and quickly became a bestseller.</p> <p>A prolific writer, he now has over twenty books in publication, including three with Janette Oke, a wonderful children's picture book called <i>Princess Bella and the Red Velvet Hat</i>, the heartwarming gift book <i>The Quilt,</i> and his latest, <i>The Dream Voyagers,</i> originally published under the pen name Thomas Locke.</p> <p>"The novels I've had published by Bethany House are the direction I hope my future writing will take--captivating stories of intrigue, drama and faith, with compelling characters in an enjoyable contemporary fictional setting," says Bunn. "The emotional bonding that occurs with the reader in good fiction often gives the Christian message more direct meaning in the reader's life."</p> <p>Prior to his work in international finance, Davis completed studies in psychology and economics at Wake Forest University. Fluent in three languages, he has traveled extensively in more than forty countries in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Davis has also avocationally become a serious student of comparative religion, learning from Jewish rabbis, Buddhist monks, Muslim imams, Catholic priests, and Baptist ministers. Drawing on these experiences, Davis fills his books with colorful dialogue and richly textured settings. </p> size : 5.4 x 8.3</p><h2>Antarctica: Both Heaven and Hell</h2><p>Messner is arguably the greatest living mountaineer/explorer.

Key Topics: It views painting, sculpture, architecture, manuscript illumination and applied arts in various contexts, including public and private are, devotional and secular art, and art related to the new forms of learning (science and the universities).In this engagingly original introductory text to art and architecture of the Gothic period, Camille (art history, Univ. of Chicago) eschews a traditional formalistic and iconographic approach. He instead examines Gothic architecture in terms of its liturgical function as a grandiose reliquary to contain holy images and relics, as a sacred image itself, as a context for sculpture and other media, and in relation to an evolving concept of transcendent light. The critical urban context of the style and its relationships to rising monarchic power and shifting religious currents are also stressed. Out of these investigations arises a deeper comprehension of the subjective potency of religious imagery as manifested in communal, devotional, and liturgical contexts. While Camille attempts to come to grips with the essentials of the Gothic style, Partridge (art history, Univ. of California, Berkeley) is content to explore the unfolding of the Renaissance style within the boundaries of 15th- and 16th-century papal Rome. In a consideration that is sensitive to the perilous condition of the church, Partridge thoughtfully reconstructs crucial artistic responses to these challenges. Not only does he retrace the history of urbanistic refurbishment and reconfiguration of the papal city, he also underlines the practical and ideological intentions of these efforts. Individual building projects are also skillfully explored, and their relationships to the historical Roman context and their symbolic significances suggested. The consideration of frescoes offers important insight into the pictorial assertion of sacred and temporal power. These volumes are the latest additions to Abrams's "Perspectives" series, meant to examine significant periods and styles within broader social and historical contexts. While both authors make assertions that go beyond the possibilities of historical knowing, the richness of scholarship, perception, and thought that characterizes these efforts should gain them inclusion in all art libraries.<br><i>Robert Cahn, Fashion Inst. of Technology, New York</i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The White Giraffe</h2><p>When Martine&#x2019;s home in England burns down, killing her parents, she must go to South Africa to live on a wildlife game preserve, called Sawubona, with the grandmother she didn&#x2019;t know she had.

Visit her at www.Anne-Stuart.com.<br><br><em>Paris, 1768</em><br><br>The visit with the lawyer had not gone well. Elinor Harriman arrived home just as her sister, Lydia, had finished dealing with their landlord, and she ducked out of sight so the old lecher wouldn't see her. Monsieur Picot had no patience for either her or her mother, but her baby sister was a different matter. All Lydia had to do was let tears fill her limpid blue eyes and make her Cupid's bow mouth tremble and M. Picot was destroyed, awash with apologies and assurances. He didn't realize he was being played until the door was firmly closed behind him and Elinor could sneak up the stairs, grateful that she hadn't had to defend Lydia's honor if M. Picot got carried away. He never did. None of the landlords and butchers and greengrocers ever took advantage of Lydia's delicate beauty. She radiated such an exquisite innocence that no one would dare. Even in this less than felicitous area of town, no one would even think of offering her an insult.<br><br>"Told you," Lydia said with an impish grin far removed from her Madonna smile. "It works every time."<br><br>Elinor flopped into the nearest chair, letting out a groan as an errant spring poked her backside. During their last enforced move they'd had to relinquish all but their most wretched of furniture. The tiny parlor on the edge of one of the least savory neighborhoods in Paris held three chairs and a meager table that served as a desk, a dining surface and a dressing table, and the chairs were barely functional. The bedrooms were as bad. One sagging bed in the first room held their mother's snoring body, in the other there was only a shared mattress on the hard floor. She refused to think about how Nanny Maude or Jacobs the coachman slept in the back area that served as kitchen and servants' quarters.<br><br>And how absurd it was to have a coachman when it had been years since they'd even had a horse, much less a coach. Not since their very first days in Paris, when their mother had been in love and the two sisters had reveled in their new adventure. But Jacobs had come with them from England, under Lady Caroline's spell as most men were, and nothing, not even a total lack of wages, could induce him to leave.<br><br>The lover and the money had disappeared quickly, to be replaced by someone almost as wealthy. In the last ten years Lady Caroline Harriman had been working her way down to a state Elinor couldn't bear to consider. At least right now her mother was too ill to cause trouble, to go looking for another bottle of blue ruin, another game of chance, another man to finance her more important needs, which had never included her daughters.<br><br>"So how much time have we got?" she asked, reaching for her knitting. She was a wretched knitter<em>&#x2014;</em>her handwork was atrocious but she convinced herself she could do something useful, even if her socks and vests were full of dropped stitches. Nanny Maude had taught her, but as usual she was proving less than adept.<br><br>Lydia sighed. "He'll be back in a week, and I don't think I'll be able to put him off again." Sweet Lydia was perfect in every way, pretty and darling and clever, and her handwork was flawless. She could dance perfectly with only the cursory lessons their mother had once paid for, she could paint a pretty picture, sing like a bird, and any man who met her became her willing slave, from Jacobs, their elderly manservant, to the wealthy young Vicomte de Miraboux whom she'd met at the lending library. For a brief time Elinor had hoped their problems were solved, until the Vicomte's family caught wind of what was going on and the Vicomte had been swept away on a grand tour of Europe.<br><br>They'd offered her money, Elinor thought, rubbing her chilled hands, and she'd probably been a fool to throw it back in their smug faces. As if a Harriman would ever stoop to being bribed. But at that moment, with M. Picot just walking away, she suddenly thought she could do almost anything if it ensured safety for Lydia and their little family. Even for their reckless mother.<br><br>Lady Caroline had been too ill to cause trouble recently. They had no money for a doctor or medicine, and the flush that had covered her body and disordered her never clear mind was a mixed blessing. Ill as she was, at least for the time being she was bedridden, unable to get them deeper in debt.<br><br>"So tell me about the lawyer, Nell," Lydia said, calling her the pet name only she used. "Has our father left us some vast fortune to ease <em>Maman's </em>final days? Or at least a minor pittance?"<br><br>"He's left us something, though a vast fortune might be too optimistic," Elinor said morosely. "His title and estates have been left to a Mr. Marcus Har-riman, and another, undoubtedly smaller amount for us. He probably wouldn't have left us anything if he could have helped it." She carefully avoided the fact that whatever inheritance existed belonged, nominally, to her. Lydia's parentage was cloudy, but most definitely had nothing to do with Elinor's father, and everyone knew it. Though British law declared a child born within a marriage to be the legal offspring of the husband, her father had been infinitely inventive in denying either child or his ex-wife any kind of support.<br><br>Lydia sighed. "Perhaps M. Picot would be put off another week if I allowed him a few liberties. A kiss would hardly compromise my soul if it kept a roof over our heads."<br><br>"No!" Elinor dropped another stitch, and tossed her knitting aside in frustration. She looked up at her sister. "The lawyer definitely said our father had left us something, though apparently there was some ridiculous stipulation that I would have to go to England to receive it. I just wish we'd known of his death sooner<em>&#x2014;</em>we could have put this in motion months ago. I expect the death notice would have gone to our former residence, and since we left in the middle of the night with our bills unpaid they would have been unlikely to pass along any correspondence that might have showed up. I'm sure it won't be too miserable an amount. He wouldn't let his daughters starve."<br><br>Lydia's brief smile was wry. "Don't try to sweeten things for me. He always said he wanted nothing to do with the spawn of the harlot he'd had the misfortune to marry. Why should he change his mind on his deathbed?"<br><br>"Well, he was still angry. It was only a few years after mother had left him, and he was the laughingstock of London. Sooner or later he must remember that we are his blood and he has some responsibility to us."<br><br>"I thought he claimed we aren't actually his children, didn't he?"<br><br>Elinor could barely remember their father. He'd been a tall, singularly unpleasant man with little interest in anything but his horses and his women. It had always seemed patently unfair to Elinor that his wife had been denounced for following similar interests, but she'd learned fairness had little to do with reality. "Of course we're his children," she said. At least Lydia had never suspected the truth about her own parentage. "I'm as tall as most men, and I have his wretched nose."<br><br>"It's a very nice nose, Nell," Lydia said gently. "It gives you character, whereas I'm just a pretty little nothing."<br><br>"There are times when I would have given a great deal to be a pretty little nothing," Elinor said morosely.<br><br>"No, you wouldn't. I don't really think you want to be anyone but yourself, if truth be told," Lydia said.<br><br>Elinor forced a laugh. "You're probably right. I always was wretchedly strong-minded. I'd like to be exactly as I am, only fabulously wealthy. That's a reasonable enough request, isn't it? Unfortunately the only way to obtain a fortune is to marry one, and The Nose precludes that."<br><br>"A very good man would appreciate you, elegant nose and all," Lydia said firmly. "And I have every intention of marrying someone fabulously wealthy, so you don't need to worry about it. You will be free to marry for love."<br><br>Elinor snorted in disbelief, a very unladylike reaction. "A lovely thought, dear. But how are you going to meet this very rich man when we're living on the edge of the Paris slums? The next move will put us in the heart of them. It's going to come to that, eventually, and I'm not quite sure we'll survive."<br><br>"I have faith," Lydia said simply. "The answer will be provided when we need it." On top of everything else Lydia was a devout Christian, whereas Elinor had lost her faith years ago, when she'd met Sir Christopher Spatts, and now she accompanied Lydia to church only as a matter of form.<br><br>"I think the answer is long overdue," she grumbled. "If you could make it hurry up I'd appreciate it."<br><br>She heard the commotion coming from the back of the apartment, and Jacobs burst into the room, his hat in his hand, his weathered old face creased with worry, Nanny Maude close behind him.<br><br>"She's gone, miss," he announced.<br><br>There was never any question who he was talking about. "What do you mean, gone?" Elinor said, jumping up. "Is she dead?"<br><br>"No, Miss Elinor," Nanny said, her voice thick with worry. "Your mother managed to find the last of the money I'd had for food, and she put on her fancy dress and left."<br><br>"Oh, dear God. How did she manage that? I thought she could barely move," Elinor said, chilled. "We can find her, can't we? She can't have gotten far."<br><br>"I almost caught her, miss," Jacobs said miserably, crushing his hat with his big, strong hands. "I thought I recognized her running down the streets, but she got in a coach before I could catch her."<br><br>"A coach? Are you sure it was my mother? I didn't realize she still knew anyone with a coach."<br><br>"It was her," Jacobs said grimly. "And I recognized the coach. Even in the streetlights I could see the crest."<br><br>"Oh, Lord," Elinor moaned. "What new disaster has she gotten us into? Whose was it?"<br><br>"St. Philippe."<br><br>"Bloody hell," Elinor said. "Don't look at me like that, Nanny Maude. I know you raised me better, but if any occasion deserved a curse then this one does. You know who St. Philippe's friend is, don't you, Jacobs?"<br><br>"I don't," Lydia piped up, her blue eyes shining with curiosity.<br><br>"You don't need to know," Elinor snapped.<br><br>"It's that devil, isn't it?" Nanny said, her voice grim. "She's gone and taken herself off to the devil's lair, where there's orgies and such, and she'll lose the tiny bit of money we have left and probably end up sacrificed to the dark one."<br><br>"I don't think they do sacrifices, Nanny," Elinor said in her most practical voice, trying to ignore her own racing heart.<br><br>"They do," Nanny said, nodding her head so vigorously her lace cap slipped off her silver hair. "Women go in there and are never seen again. They kill virgins and drink their blood."<br><br>"Well, if it's virgins they kill then I think our mother's safe," Elinor drawled, determined to take the terrified look off her sister's face. "And I doubt anyone will be so besotted with her that she'll disappear. She'll gamble away the money and then come crawling home, sick and helpless."<br><br>"You don't understand, miss," said Nanny. "It's the only money we have left. And she took the diamond brooch."<br><br>A cold chill ran down the center of Elinor's body. It was the last thing of value they owned, a poor piece with tiny, flawed diamonds that was worth very little, but she'd kept it hidden for an emergency that didn't involve their deliberately self-destructive mother. She straightened her shoulders. "Then I'll simply have to go after her."<br><br>She ignored Nanny's howl of protest. Jacobs said nothing<em>&#x2014;</em>he knew there was no other choice. Lydia rose. "I'm going with you, Nell."<br><br>"You certainly are not. If I walk into that den of iniquity I know I'm safe. They'd be on you like a pack of ravening wolves."<br><br>"I think you overestimate my irresistibility," Lydia said with a grin.<br><br>"And I think you underestimate it. Nanny said they drink the blood of virgins, remember?" she said with just enough lightness to allay her sister's fears.<br><br>Unfortunately Lydia could see right through her. "You're a virgin too, darling, unless you've been keeping something from me. They'll drink your blood too."<br><br>Elinor didn't even flinch. "They won't be drinking anyone's blood. They thrive on scandal and secrecy, but I suspect they're not nearly as dangerous as they pretend to be," she said in a matter-of-fact voice.<br><br>"They murder babies," Nanny contributed helpfully.<br><br>"Hush," Elinor said. "I'mhardly ababy. Jacobs will take me to the house of the Comte de Giverney and we will extract our mother and be back before midnight."<br><br>"Begging your pardon, miss, but they were heading out of town," Jacobs said. "I think they've gone to his ch�teau."<br><br>Elinor remained calm. "And how far away is that?"<br><br>"Not far, miss. An hour out of town if we hurry."<br><br>"Then we'll be back by dawn," she said. "Safe and sound, and this time we'll tie mother to the bed when we can't watch her."<br><br>"And how do you intend to get there?" Lydia said. "Last I heard we had no coach, nor horses, nor money to rent them. Are you intending to walk?"<br><br>Elinor shared a knowing glance with Jacobs, who backed out of the room without another word. "Jacobs will handle it," she said smoothly. "In the meantime I'm counting on you to make certain Mother's room is clean and ready for her. We'll probably have to use the restraints we had from the time she was raving. It will depend on how much gin she's drunk and if she's been fed anything else dangerous."<br><br>"I don't want you going there alone."<br><br>"I'll go with her," Nanny said, bless her elderly heart. She was so crippled with the rheumatics that she could hardly walk, but she'd fight a dragoon of soldiers for her babies.<br><br>"No, Nanny," she said gently. "I need you to look after Lydia." She met Nanny's gaze for a moment, and a world of understanding passed between them. If by any bizarre chance Elinor didn't come back Lydia would need someone, and Nanny was their only choice.<br><br>Nanny nodded her head, and Elinor could see tears shining in her eyes. "Don't be ridiculous, you two. I'm not walking into the gates of hell. The Comte de Giverney is just a man who throws decadent parties, not Satan himself, and I'm hardly the type of female to inflame his darker passions. Besides, Jacobs carries a pistol, and he'd shoot the first man who tried to harm me. I'll go in, ask for my mother, and they'll probably be happy enough to get rid of her. So there's nothing to worry about."<br><br></p><h2>The Fall of Shane Mackade: The Mackade Brothers</h2><p><b>A New York Times Bestselling Author</b><p> First published almost a decade ago, the MacKade Brothers books have long been out of print.

As the title suggests, this collection of anecdotes about 15 famous artists of European heritage (and Hokusai) is gossipy. Tidbits flood the brief biographies: Leonardo's and Michelangelo's homosexuality, Van Gogh's "ear episode," Bruegel's fondness for practical jokes, Cassatt's support of women's suffrage, etc. These morsels are integrated into chapters with an easy-flowing sequence of short paragraphs, and supplemented with an "Artworks" section that adds a few pithy comments about several specific pieces, such as O'Keeffe's bone paintings or Kollowitz's large granite memorial for her son Peter. Hewitt supplies a full-page watercolor and colored-pencil portrait and vignette for each artist.

He lives with his wife Caroline in the Forest of Dean.Through the voice of Alex Jennings, we are guided through a tale of darkness and romance, intrigue and mystery, which features Edgar Allan Poe's father and young Poe himself as the epon-ymous boy. Jennings reads with such enormous variety that we are consumed by his characterizations, which include wheezing drunkards, schoolboys, and shy housemaids. He fulfills the role of a schoolmaster who is haphazardly drawn into the lives of two of his students. Through their families he becomes entangled in a network of questions and oddities that could result in his own death. The listener becomes completely absorbed with the persona of the novel. J.P.

She first attracted critical attention with the dazzling black-and-white paintings she began to make in 1961. Her participation in the seminal exhibition The Responsive Eye at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1965 and her triumph at the Venice Biennale in 1968 - when she became the first living British painter to win the International Prize for painting - established her as an artist of the first rank.<br>Bridget Riley surveys the artist's entire career and includes key examples of all phases of her work. It offers the opportunity both to review many early, celebrated paintings and to see these afresh in the context of recent works in which light, colour, movement and space are drawn into fresh and unexpected relationships. Numerous preparatory working studies are reproduced to illuminate the artist's complex and fascinating working processes.<br>Essays from Paul Moorhouse, Richard Shiff and Robert Kudielka provide an overview of her art and career, along with new insights into the relation of Riley's work to theories of aesthetics and perception.</p><p>Paul Moorhouse is a collections curator at Tate and the author of numerous books and exhibition catalogues.

Stannard (English/Univ. of Leicester) incorporates hundreds of previously unpublished documents and unreported interviews in picking up Waugh's tale on the eve of WW II. Britain plunges into the war, and Waugh wangles his way into one of the elite (i.e., aristocrat-led) military units. Thus, army life did nothing to temper Waugh's all-pervasive hauteur. His military career, however, was little short of disastrous, as the writer--surly, snobbish, and almost perpetually soused--was deemed unfit to command a regiment, a fact that rankled and eventually embittered him. With war's end, Waugh's most subtly wrought novel, Brideshead Revisited, was published to widespread acclaim both in Britain and the US. Royalties poured in, and the author was launched on a spendthrift's path to penury. The Loved One, a satire of America's bizarre funerary fashions, proved an even greater success in 1948, and soon Waugh was moving in exalted circles. His fellow-Catholic author Graham Greene was an intimate; Thomas Merton confided in him; Ian Fleming's wife, Ann, according to Stannard no slouch herself at backbiting, kept Waugh supplied with vicious gossip. An especially engrossing section here deals with Waugh's bout with psychosis, during which he heard voices accusing him of worthlessness and perversity. Stannard's depiction of his subject's unconventional home life is equally revealing. A no-holds-barred yet ultimately moving portrait of a major literary talent. (Photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Readers who have been eagerly awaiting the second and concluding volume of Stannard's biography of British writer Evelyn Waugh (1903-1966) will not be disappointed. As exhaustively detailed as Evelyn Waugh: The Early Years, this study deals with Waugh in middle age, from his undistinguished experience as an army officer during WW II through the writing of some of his best-known works: Brides head Revisited (1945), The Loved One (1948) and The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold (1957). Relying on letters and other primary sources, Stannard gives us insight into Waugh's life as a husband and father. He treated his understanding and resilient second wife, Laura, with neglect and dictatorial disregard for her feelings. His children took second place to his self-absorption, although his guilt over his personal failures was severe. He remained a committed Roman Catholic, frequently exhorting his friends to follow his example. An excellent portrait of a selfish, reactionary snob who was redeemed by his talent, his self-awareness and his frequent bursts of charity.

Merton wrote, and heard from, many prominent writers of the stature of Waugh, Jacques Maritain, Czeslaw Milosz, Boris Pasternak, James Baldwin, Walker Percy, Henry Miller, and Victoria Ocampo. He also corresponded with and encouraged newer writers in Latin America, like Ernesto Cardenal.<br>Merton sensed in these writers a hope for the future of humanity and believed that the courage for truth was their special gift. Writing to Jose Coronel Urtecho, Merton asserted that poets "remain almost the only ones who have anything to say . . . They have the courage to disbelieve what is shouted with the greatest amount of noise from every loudspeaker."<br>Courage rooted in true freedom is evident in Merton's own life. He shared with his literary friends his concerns about war, violence and repression, racism and injustice, and all forms of human aggression. Forbidden to publish on the subject of war by his superiors, he obeyed but continued to circulate his famous "Cold War Letters." He did not hesitate to criticize his church when he saw there was more concern for the institutional structure than there was for people. Merton especially admired those who had the courage to write under oppression, like Pasternak, Milosz, and Cardenal.</p><p>Though he lived in an enclosed order, Thomas Merton was the most sociable of monks by mail. His first letter in this ever-surprising volume is to Evelyn Waugh, who in 1948 was editing <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i> for English publication. Recounting how his work runs a gantlet of religious censors before being further altered by his publishers, Merton adds, "And after about four years a book appears in print." Hence, he pleads, "I need criticism the way a man dying of thirst needs water." The paradoxes of his life are all here: his great faith, his frustration with earthly authority, his obligation to honesty, and his essential sophistication. This is the man who "read <i>Decline and Fall</i> and <i>Vile Bodies</i> over more than any other book except for <i>Ulysses</i>: I mean before coming here."<p> <i>The Courage for Truth</i> includes 20 years of Merton's correspondence with fellow writers, among them Czeslaw Milosz, Boris Pasternak, James Baldwin, and even Henry Miller. Over time Merton's order gave him increasing intellectual and political leeway--though never quite enough. In one letter, he assures Milosz: "You can say nothing about the Church that can shock me. If I stay with the Church it is out of a disillusioned love, and with a realization that I myself could not be happy outside, though I have no guarantee of being happy inside either. In effect, my 'happiness' does not depend on any institution or establishment. As for you, you are part of my 'Church' of friends who are in many ways more important to me than the institution."</p>Thomas Merton (1915-1968) was born in France and came to live in the United States at the age of 24. He received several awards recognizing his contribution to religious study and contemplation, including the Pax Medal in 1963, and remained a devoted spiritualist and a tireless advocate for social justice until his death in 1968. The Sign of Jonas was originally published in 1953.</p><h2>Megawords: Assessment of Decoding and Encoding Skills, A Criterion-referenced Test, Test Manual (Edu</h2><p>Megawords: Assessment of Decoding and Encoding Skills, A Criterion-referenced Test, Test Manual (Educators Publishing Service)</p><p></p><h2>Making Lahore Modern: Constructing and Imagining a Colonial City</h2><p><p>Fifty years after the British annexed the Punjab and made Lahore its provincial capital, the city&#x2014;once a prosperous Mughal center that had long since fallen into ruin&#x2014;was transformed. British and Indian officials had designed a modern, architecturally distinct city center adjacent to the old walled city, administered under new methods of urban governance. </p><p>In Making Lahore Modern, William J. Glover investigates the traditions that shaped colonial Lahore. In particular, he focuses on the conviction that both British and Indian actors who implemented urbanization came to share: that the material fabric of the city could lead to social and moral improvement. This belief in the power of the physical environment to shape individual and collective sentiments, he argues, links the colonial history of Lahore to nineteenth-century urbanization around the world.</p><p>Glover highlights three aspects of Lahore&#x2019;s history that show this process unfolding. First, he examines the concepts through which the British understood the Indian city and envisioned its transformation. Second, through a detailed study of new buildings and the adaptation of existing structures, he explores the role of planning, design, and reuse. Finally, he analyzes the changes in urban imagination as evidenced in Indian writings on the city in this period. Throughout, Glover emphasizes that colonial urbanism was not simply imposed; it was a collaborative project between Indian citizens and the British. </p><p>Offering an in-depth study of a single provincial city, Glover reveals that urban change in colonial India was not a monolithic process and establishes Lahore as a key site for understanding the genealogy of modern global urbanism.</p><p>William J. Glover is associate professor of architecture at the University of Michigan.</p></p><p></p><h2>Batman: Night Cries</h2><p>Square Bound Graphic Novel.</p><p></p><h2>Public Figures (Wesleyan Poetry Series)</h2><p>Public Figures is an essay-poem with photographs and text that begins with a playful thought experiment: statues of people in public spaces have eyes, but what are they looking at? To answer that question, Jena Osman sets up a camera to track the gaze of a number of statues in Philadelphia&#x2015;mostly 19th century military figures carrying weapons. How does their point of view differ from our own? And how does it compare, say, to the point of view of other watchful military figures, such as drone pilots? In this book, Osman combines the histories behind these statues with poetic narratives that ask us to think about our own relational positions, and how our own everyday gaze may be complicit with the gun-sights of war. Public Figures illustrates how history is transformed, and even erased, by monuments and other public records of events. Through poetry, those histories can be made visible again.

An architect of complex maps, Osman's exploration of the multiple point-of-view in Public Figures becomes the central point, and one that is questioned throughout.

You, the visitor, are the monument. You activate the idea. A true improvisatory device, Public Figures embodies the noblest kind of heat-seeking countermonument."&#x2015;Rachel Zolf, author of Neighbour Procedure</p><p>"The essayistic concept at the heart of the book is brilliant. Like the best documentary work, Public Figures answers the hand-wringing question of 'how can art be political' rather simply: you make it about the world. As in the passage quoted above, the playfully intent moments of Osman's guidebook (there are some fantastic pages in which Osman diagrams the intersecting gazes of several martial statues) enliven one's historical imagination, while also revealing a 'you' that moves in our shared present."&#x2015;Zach Savich, <i>Kenyon Review</i></p><p>"What Osman's politically-engaged text does is force us to confront the alternating ugliness and meaninglessness of our historical sense, not to mention the travesties of language that that benighted sense often compels us to endorse. Public Figures is a compelling read from every and any angle."&#x2015;Seth Abramson, <i>Huffington Post</i></p><p>"Osman puts public memory back in the public memorials."&#x2015;Rachel Trousdale, <i>Rain Taxi</i></p><p>"As much as it objects to some wars far away, the essay keeps its heart in Osman's Philly, whose streetscapes point both to the present and back to the U.S. Civil War.

Others were published in The Paris Review, Atlantic Monthly, Cosmopolitan, Redbook, and McCall's. Her work was included in twenty-three O. Henry Award collections, and she received first prize six times; she was represented in numerous collections of Martha Foley's Best American Short Stories. <br><br>Now the best of Alice Adams's short fiction is gathered in one volume-fifty-three stories that illumine the hidden workings of human relationships. In "Verlie I Say Unto You," the unexpected death of Verlie Jones's lover reveals the unsettling truth about her employers-that, though they "couldn't get along without" Verlie, their maid of ten years, she is nothing more than a stranger to them. In "Berkeley House," a disenfranchised daughter anguished over the sale of her childhood home finally succeeds in winning the house back, only to discover that it does not hold the key to her happiness, and perhaps never did. In "Greyhound People," a woman repeatedly, and purposely, takes the wrong bus home from work after meeting its warm and disarmingly candid cast of passengers, a refreshing and life-changing break from the coldly polite company she finds on the "right" bus-and at home. <br><br>In story after story, insight joins with grace to show us the truth about the lives of people around us. A moving and elegant collection and the capstone to the brilliant career of one of the most beloved American writers of our time.</p><p>The late, great Alice Adams mastered the art of the short story. In the posthumous collection <i>The Stories of Alice Adams</i>, Adams masters something more significant in the genre--the backstory, the carefully realized context in which a story is able to unfold. In the 53 stories collected here, Adams moves effortlessly between the current thread of the situation and the past circumstances that allow it to happen in the first place. Nearly all of her carefully drawn characters look back at their lives, or at someone else's life, as if to reconstruct what makes a particular person unique. A group of friends awaits a newly widowed husband in "Waiting for Stella," and in their suppositions about his grief and tardiness, the dead woman comes back to life as a prominent character. Adams weaves youth, age, past, and present together seamlessly; she darts in and out of people's heads in a restaurant, as in "At the Beach," so that they wonder about each other thoroughly but never interact. In this stellar compilation, Adams revels in the glories and oddities of the human condition and distills the very essence of how we live. <i>--Emily Russin</i>Joyce Carol Oates described her "inimitable voice" as "quick, deft, brilliantly evocative." <br><br>"No other writer in recent memory has called to mind quite so clearly the work of F.

I&#x2019;d been researching and developing this particular novel through most of the previous decade; after a couple of false starts, the time had finally come to put it down on paper.</p><p>As things turned out, though, the story was too big for one novel, so I decided to write a sequel, <i>Coyote Rising</i>, which would tie up the threads left hanging at the end of the first book. Yet that wasn&#x2019;t enough, either; by the time I finished the second book, I&#x2019;d come to realize that I still hadn&#x2019;t answered a lot of questions I myself had put forward. As a result, a third book became necessary, and thus I wrote <i>Coyote Frontier</i>.</p><p>Once the Coyote trilogy was finished, I turned my attention to other matters, including a couple of independent novels&#x2014;<i>Spindrift</i> and <i>Galaxy Blues</i>&#x2014;set in the same universe. Then something happened that I didn&#x2019;t expect.</p><p>When reviews of <i>Coyote Frontier</i> started coming in, quite a few critics expressed the opinion that, while it was obvious that I&#x2019;d wrapped up the story line, there was more about Coyote that remained to be told. Then I began receiving fan mail from readers, with the majority asking me to write more. One reader used the maps Ron Miller and I had created to build a globe of Coyote; it now rests on my desk as a reference tool. Another took my description of the Coyote Federation flag to make one for me; it&#x2019;s taped to my notebook. Yet another went so far as to create an entire fan website that included interactive maps and lists of all the major characters, events, starships, and locales mentioned in the books (you can visit it at www.coyoteseries.com). Not long after that, <i>Coyote</i> entered the curriculum of university science-fiction courses, with one student emailing me to ask questions for a dissertation she was writing about the trilogy.</p><p>Motivated by the attention, I decided to write some short fiction about Coyote. The first story, &#x201c;Walking Star,&#x201d; occurred after the events of <i>Coyote Frontier</i>; a slightly different version appears in this novel as Part Two. A second novella, &#x201c;The River Horses,&#x201d; filled in the gap between <i>Coyote</i> and <i>Coyote Rising</i>. And a short story, &#x201c;The War of Dogs and Boids,&#x201d; related an incident that didn&#x2019;t make its way into <i>Coyote</i>. I thought these stories would satisfy everyone, but they only added fuel to the fire. Readers continued to insist that I write more about the world I had created, and after a while I came to realize that, although the original story arc was complete, I wasn&#x2019;t finished with this place yet.</p><p>It should be pointed out that <i>Coyote Horizon</i> isn&#x2019;t the &#x201c;fourth book of the trilogy&#x201d; but rather the first volume of a duology; the second volume, <i>Coyote Destiny</i>, will conclude the story arc. Although astute readers of this series may notice that the events of <i>Coyote Horizon</i> are roughly concurrent with those depicted in <i>Galaxy Blues</i>, it isn&#x2019;t necessary to read the other book first in order to understand this novel.</p><p>This novel is dedicated to everyone who asked for more.

Built of sturdy blackwood imported from Great Dakota, with a slate roof cantilevered at a forty-five-degree angle, the manor overlooked the channel and the port town of Bridgeton and, on the other side of the Divide, the grassy flatlands that lay southwest of Liberty. The residence had its own wind turbine, a slender pylon on which three blades slowly rotated in the early-spring breeze, as well as a satellite dish perched on a corner of the roof. Although visible for many miles, the house could only be reached by a narrow dirt road that wound its way up the ridge.</p><p>President Gunther&#x2019;s personal aide had recommended that she come ahead of time, so Lynn Hu made sure that she arrived at Traveler&#x2019;s Rest an hour before her scheduled appointment. It wasn&#x2019;t until the cab she&#x2019;d hired in Liberty came to a halt at the front gate at the bottom of the ridge, though, that she knew why. An iron-barred arch eight feet tall, the gate was the sole point of entry through the chain-link fence surrounding the estate. Although the bluff was steep enough to challenge even the most dedicated of climbers, the fence extended all up the side of the Divide, prohibiting anyone from climbing over. If that weren&#x2019;t enough, solar-powered floodlights and surveillance cameras were positioned on posts within the fence.</p><p>To be sure, the couple who lived here had good reason to guard their privacy. Yet in the three weeks that she&#x2019;d been on Coyote, Lynn hadn&#x2019;t seen this measure of protection since going through customs at the New Brighton spaceport. Even Government House was remarkably accessible; all she&#x2019;d had to do to arrange a meeting with the current president was present her credentials and have a brief chat with a couple of bureaucrats before she was escorted upstairs to his office.</p><p>Despite his colorful past&#x2014;an uncle who&#x2019;d been a hero of the Revolution, teenage years spent as a member of the Rigil Kent Brigade, being elected mayor of Clarksburg despite having a notorious brother who was murdered by his own son&#x2014;Garth Thompson had given her a boring interview, with little worth quoting save as background material. Yet in the end, he&#x2019;d come through with what Lynn really wanted: a satphone call to Traveler&#x2019;s Rest, setting up an appointment for her to see the very person whom she&#x2019;d traveled forty-six light-years to meet.</p><p>And so here she was. Lynn paid the driver <i>C</i>10, adding a couple of colonials as a tip. He pocketed the money without so much as a word, then reached up to shut the gullwing door; the coupe rose on its skirts and turned around to glide back down Swamp Road toward town. Stepping closer to the gate, Lynn noticed a small metal box on a post next to the gate. Raising its hinged cover, she found an intercom.</p><p>She pressed its button, bent closer. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</i> The voice from the speaker was male, with the Hispanic accent of someone born in the Western Hemisphere Union back on Earth. <i>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s calling, please?&#x201d;</i></p><p>&#x201c;Lynn Hu . . . Pan News Service. I have an appointment with . . .&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Of course, senorita. We&#x2019;ve been expecting you.&#x201d;</i> A brief buzz, then the right half of the gate slowly swung open. <i>&#x201c;Please come up.&#x201d;</i></p><p>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; Lynn started to step through the gate, then stopped as something occurred to her. &#x201c;Umm . . . come up, you said?&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</i></p><p>She stared at the dirt road leading up the ridge and swallowed. No signs that any vehicles had recently come this way. Nothing that looked like a tram. She heard the chitter of small birds&#x2014;grasshoarders, she&#x2019;d learned they were called&#x2014;within the high grass on either side of the road; a skeeter buzzed past her face, and she swatted it away.</p><p>&#x201c;Walk, you mean,&#x201d; she added.</p><p>No response from the intercom, yet as she strolled through the gate, it silently closed behind her, locking with a definitive click. Realizing that argument was pointless, she took a deep breath, then set out to climb the rest of the way to Traveler&#x2019;s Rest.</p><p>The ascent was less difficult than it appeared. The house was only about three hundred yards from the bottom of the bluffs, with the road cut in a series of switchbacks that afforded an easy grade. Yet, although someone born and raised on Coyote probably would have considered it little more than morning exercise, Lynn had only recently become acclimated to the thin atmosphere; when she&#x2019;d left the inn in Liberty, she hadn&#x2019;t expected to go hiking. So her linen business suit was drenched with sweat and her sandals filled with sand by the time she arrived, out of breath and gasping, at the top of the ridge.</p><p>Traveler&#x2019;s Rest was magnificent. Tall cathedral windows looked out upon carefully cultivated gardens, their beds planted with flowers both native to Coyote and imported from Earth, lending color to a place where it was least expected. Wooden stairs led her up a low retaining wall to a semicircular veranda upon which Adirondack chairs and potted shrubs had been set out; she noticed a small refractor telescope on a tripod, its capped lens pointed toward the sky. As she came closer, Lynn was startled to hear a horse whinny; looking around, she spotted a chestnut mare peering at her from the half door of a shed beneath the wind turbine. Horses were still scarce on this world, and most were working animals, yet this one was obviously a pet, something a rich person would ride every now and then.</p><p>She was about to walk over to the shed when a carved blackwood door opened on the veranda. A young man, not much older than herself and wearing a homespun tunic and trousers, stepped out. &#x201c;Ms. Hu? I&#x2019;m Tomas Conseco, the president&#x2019;s personal aide. Would you follow me, please?&#x201d;</p><p>The foyer was cool after the unseasonal warmth of the morning, the lighting subdued. &#x201c;You may leave your shoes there,&#x201d; Tomas said, motioning to a row of boots and moccasins carefully arranged on the tile floor beside the door. As Lynn gratefully slipped off her sandals, he offered her a hempcloth towel. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a long walk here,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;d like to freshen up a bit, the guest bath is just over here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, thank you. This will be fine.&#x201d; She ran the towel across her face and neck, mopping her sweat. Suddenly, her business suit felt too warm. &#x201c;Is there any place where I may . . . ?&#x201d; She plucked a...</p></p><h2>Missing Child</h2><p><p>Heart-pounding domestic suspense from an internationally-bestselling author - One morning Caitlin Eckhart receives a phone call that changes her life forever &#x2013; her much-loved six-year-old stepson Geordie has disappeared from school.

Her previous novels include &#34;&#34;Suspicious Origin, Stranger in the House, Not Guilty, &#34;&#34; and the Edgar Award-nominated &#34;&#34;The Unforgiven.&#34;&#34; She lives with her husband and daughter in New Jersey, where she is working on her next novel.Caitlin Eckhart&#x2019;s six-year-old stepson, Geordie, runs ahead of her into the school auditorium to see the exhibits at the Fall Festival, disappearing into the crowd. Caitlin looks at Geordie&#x2019;s project, talks to his teacher, and then leaves for work without seeing Geordie again. When the boy doesn&#x2019;t show up for class, Caitlin, as his stepmother and the last person to see him before his disappearance, is soon being asked some rather pointed questions by the police. Things come to a head when Noah, Caitlin&#x2019;s husband and Geordie&#x2019;s father, learns a dark secret from Caitlin&#x2019;s past and asks her to leave their home.

Moyd.</p><p></p><h2>How to Fly a Horse: The Secret History of Creation, Invention, and Discovery</h2><p><p>As a technology pioneer at MIT and as the leader of three successful start-ups, Kevin Ashton experienced firsthand the all-consuming challenge of creating something new. Now, in a tour-de-force narrative twenty years in the making, Ashton leads us on a journey through humanity&#x2019;s greatest creations to uncover the surprising truth behind who creates and how they do it. From the crystallographer&#x2019;s laboratory where the secrets of DNA were first revealed by a long forgotten woman, to the electromagnetic chamber where the stealth bomber was born on a twenty-five-cent bet, to the Ohio bicycle shop where the Wright brothers set out to &#x201c;fly a horse,&#x201d; Ashton showcases the seemingly unremarkable individuals, gradual steps, multiple failures, and countless ordinary and usually uncredited acts that lead to our most astounding breakthroughs.<br><br>Creators, he shows, apply in particular ways the everyday, ordinary thinking of which we are all capable, taking thousands of small steps and working in an endless loop of problem and solution. He examines why innovators meet resistance and how they overcome it, why most organizations stifle creative people, and how the most creative organizations work. Drawing on examples from art, science, business, and invention, from Mozart to the Muppets, Archimedes to Apple, Kandinsky to a can of Coke, <i>How to Fly a Horse</i> is a passionate and immensely rewarding exploration of how &#x201c;new&#x201d; comes to be.</p></p><p><p>Kevin Ashton led pioneering work on RFID (radio frequency identification) networks, for which he coined the term &#x201c;the Internet of Things,&#x201d; and cofounded the Auto-ID Center at MIT.&nbsp;His writing about innovation and technology has appeared in <i>Quartz</i>, <i>Medium</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, and <i>The New York Times</i>.</p>CHAPTER&nbsp;1<br>Creating Is Ordinary<br><br>1 | Edmond<br><br>In the Indian Ocean, fifteen hundred miles east of Africa and four thousand miles west of Australia, lies an island that the Portuguese knew as Santa Apol�nia, the British as Bourbon, and the French, for a time, as �le Bonaparte. Today it is called R�union. A bronze statue stands in Sainte-�Suzanne, one of R�union&#x2019;s oldest towns. It shows an African boy in 1841, dressed as if for church, in a single-�breasted jacket, bow tie, and flat-�front pants that gather on the ground. He wears no shoes. He holds out his right hand, not in greeting but with his thumb and fingers coiled against his palm, perhaps about to flip a coin. He is twelve years old, an orphan and a slave, and his name is Edmond.<br><br>The world has few statues of Africa&#x2019;s enslaved children. To understand why Edmond stands here, on this lonely ocean speck, his hand held just so, we must travel west and back, thousands of miles and hundreds of years.<br><br>On Mexico&#x2019;s Gulf Coast, the people of Papantla have dried the fruit of a vinelike orchid and used it as a spice for more millennia than they remember. In 1400, the Aztecs took it as tax and called it &#x201c;black flower.&#x201d; In 1519, the Spanish introduced it to Europe and called it &#x201c;little pod,&#x201d; or vainilla. In 1703, French botanist Charles Plumier renamed it &#x201c;vanilla.&#x201d;<br><br>Vanilla is hard to farm. Vanilla orchids are great creeping plants, not at all like the Phalaenopsis flowers we put in our homes. They can live for centuries and grow large, sometimes covering thousands of square feet or climbing five stories high. It has been said that lady&#x2019;s slippers are the tallest orchids and tigers the most massive, but vanilla dwarfs them both. For thousands of years, its flower was a secret known only to the people who grew it. It is not black, as the Aztecs were led to believe, but a pale tube that blooms once a year and dies in a morning. If a flower is pollinated, it produces a long, green, beanlike capsule that takes nine months to ripen. It must be picked at precisely the right time. Too soon and it will be too small; too late and it will split and spoil. Picked beans are left in the sun for days, until they stop ripening. They do not smell of vanilla yet. That aroma develops during curing: two weeks on wool blankets outdoors each day before being wrapped to sweat each night. Then the beans are dried for four months and finished by hand with straightening and massage. The result is oily black lashes worth their weight in silver or gold.<br><br>Vanilla captivated the Europeans. Anne of Austria, daughter of Spain&#x2019;s King Philip III, drank it in hot chocolate. Queen Elizabeth I of England ate it in puddings. King Henry IV of France made adulterating it a criminal offense punishable by a beating. Thomas Jefferson discovered it in Paris and wrote America&#x2019;s first recipe for vanilla ice cream.<br><br>But no one outside Mexico could make it grow. For three hundred years, vines transported to Europe would not flower. It was only in 1806 that vanilla first bloomed in a London greenhouse and three more decades before a plant in Belgium bore Europe&#x2019;s first fruit.<br><br>The missing ingredient was whatever pollinated the orchid in the wild. The flower in London was a chance occurrence. The fruit in Belgium came from complicated artificial pollination. It was not until late in the nineteenth century that Charles Darwin inferred that a Mexican insect must be vanilla&#x2019;s pollinator, and not until late in the twentieth century that the insect was identified as a glossy green bee called Euglossa viridissima. Without the pollinator, Europe had a problem. Demand for vanilla was increasing, but Mexico was producing only one or two tons a year. The Europeans needed another source of supply. The Spanish hoped vanilla would thrive in the Philippines. The Dutch planted it in Java. The British sent it to India. All attempts failed.<br><br>This is where Edmond enters. He was born in Sainte-�Suzanne in 1829. At that time R�union was called Bourbon. His mother, M�lise, died in childbirth. He did not know his father. Slaves did not have last names&#x2014;�he was simply &#x201c;Edmond.&#x201d; When Edmond was a few years old, his owner, Elvire Bellier-�Beaumont, gave him to her brother Ferr�ol in nearby Belle-�Vue. Ferr�ol owned a plantation. Edmond grew up following Ferr�ol Bellier-�Beaumont around the estate, learning about its fruits, vegetables, and flowers, including one of its oddities&#x2014;�a vanilla vine Ferr�ol had kept alive since 1822.<br><br>Like all the vanilla on R�union, Ferr�ol&#x2019;s vine was sterile. French colonists had been trying to grow the plant on the island since 1819. After a few false starts&#x2014;�some orchids were the wrong species, some soon died&#x2014;�they eventually had a hundred live vines. But R�union saw no more success with vanilla than Europe&#x2019;s other colonies had. The orchids seldom flowered and never bore fruit.<br><br>Then, one morning late in 1841, as the spring of the Southern Hemisphere came to the island, Ferr�ol took his customary walk with Edmond and was surprised to find two green capsules hanging from the vine. His orchid, barren for twenty years, had fruit. What came next surprised him even more. Twelve-�year-�old Edmond said he had pollinated the plant himself.<br><br>To this day there are people in R�union who do not believe it. It seems impossible to them that a child, a slave and, above all, an African, could have solved the problem that beat Europe for hundreds of years. They say it was an accident&#x2014;�that he was trying to damage the flowers after an argument with Ferr�ol or he was busy seducing a girl in the gardens when it happened.<br><br>Ferr�ol did not believe the boy at first. But when more fruit appeared, days later, he asked for a demonstration. Edmond pulled back the lip of a vanilla flower and, using a toothpick-�sized piece of bamboo to lift the part that prevents self-�fertilization, he gently pinched its pollen-�bearing anther and pollen-�receiving stigma together. Today the French call this le geste d&#x2019;Edmond&#x2014;�Edmond&#x2019;s gesture. Ferr�ol called the other plantation owners together, and soon Edmond was traveling the island teaching other slaves how to pollinate vanilla orchids. After seven years, R�union&#x2019;s annual production was a hundred pounds of dried vanilla pods. After ten years, it was two tons. By the end of the century, it was two hundred tons and had surpassed the output of Mexico.<br><br>Ferr�ol freed Edmond in June 1848, six months before most of R�union&#x2019;s other slaves. Edmond was given the last name Albius, the Latin word for &#x201c;whiter.&#x201d; Some suspect this was a compliment in racially charged R�union. Others think it was an insult from the naming registry. Whatever the intention, things went badly. Edmond left the plantation for the city and was imprisoned for theft. Ferr�ol was unable to prevent the incarceration but succeeded in getting Edmond released after three years instead of five. Edmond died in 1880, at the age of fifty-�one. A small story in a R�union newspaper, Le Moniteur, described it as a &#x201c;destitute and miserable end.&#x201d;<br><br>Edmond&#x2019;s innovation spread to Mauritius, the Seychelles, and the huge island to R�union&#x2019;s west, Madagascar. Madagascar has a perfect environment for vanilla. By the twentieth century, it was producing most of the world&#x2019;s vanilla, with a crop that in some years was worth more than $100 million.<br><br>The demand for vanilla increased with the supply. Today it is the world&#x2019;s most popular spice and, after saffron, the second most expensive. It has become an ingredient in thousands of things, some obvious, some not. Over a third of the world&#x2019;s ice cream is Jefferson&#x2019;s original flavor, vanilla. Vanilla is the principal flavoring in Coke, and the Coca-�Cola Company is said to be the world&#x2019;s largest vanilla buyer. The fine fragrances Chanel No. 5, Opium, and Angel use the world&#x2019;s most expensive vanilla, worth $10,000 a pound. Most chocolate contains vanilla. So do many cleaning products, beauty products, and candles. In 1841, on the day of Edmond&#x2019;s demonstration to Ferr�ol, the world produced fewer than two thousand vanilla beans, all in Mexico, all the result of pollination by bees. On the same day in 2010, the world produced more than five million vanilla beans, in countries including Indonesia, China, and Kenya, almost all of them&#x2014;�including the ones grown in Mexico&#x2014;�the result of le geste d&#x2019;Edmond.<br>2 | Counting Creators<br><br>What is unusual about Edmond&#x2019;s story is not that a young slave created something important but that he got the credit for it. Ferr�ol worked hard to ensure that Edmond was remembered. He told R�union&#x2019;s plantation owners that it was Edmond who first pollinated vanilla. He lobbied on Edmond&#x2019;s behalf, saying, &#x201c;This young negro deserves recognition from this country. It owes him a debt, for starting up a new industry with a fabulous product.&#x201d; When Jean Michel Claude Richard, director of R�union&#x2019;s botanical gardens, said he had developed the technique and shown it to Edmond, Ferr�ol intervened. &#x201c;Through old age, faulty memory or some other cause,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;Mr. Richard now imagines that he himself discovered the secret of how to pollinate vanilla, and imagines that he taught the technique to the person who discovered it! Let us leave him to his fantasies.&#x201d; Without Ferr�ol&#x2019;s great effort, the truth would have been lost.<br><br>In most cases, the truth has been lost. We do not know, for example, who first realized that the fruit of an orchid could be cured until it tastes good. Vanilla is an innovation inherited from people long forgotten. This is not exceptional; it is normal. Most of our world is made of innovations inherited from people long forgotten&#x2014;�not people who were rare but people who were common.<br><br>Before the Renaissance, concepts like authorship, inventorship, or claiming credit barely existed. Until the early fifteenth century, &#x201c;author&#x201d; meant &#x201c;father,&#x201d; from the Latin word for &#x201c;master,&#x201d; auctor. Auctor-�ship implied authority, something that, in most of the world, had been the divine right of kings and religious leaders since Gilgamesh ruled Uruk four thousand years earlier. It was not to be shared with mere mortals. An &#x201c;inventor,&#x201d; from invenire, &#x201c;find,&#x201d; was a discoverer, not a creator, until the 1550s. &#x201c;Credit,&#x201d; from credo, &#x201c;trust,&#x201d; did not mean &#x201c;acknowledgment&#x201d; until the late sixteenth century.<br><br>This is one reason we know so little about who made what before the late 1300s. It is not that no records were made&#x2014;�writing has been around for millennia. Nor is it that there was no creation&#x2014;�everything we use today has roots stretching back to the beginning of humanity. The problem is that, until the Renaissance, people who created things didn&#x2019;t matter much. The idea that at least some people who create things should be recognized was a big step forward. It is why we know that Johannes Gutenberg invented printing in Germany in 1440 but not who invented windmills in England in 1185, and that Giunta Pisano painted the crucifix in Bologna&#x2019;s Basilica of San Domenico in 1250 but not who made the mosaic of Saint Demetrios in Kiev&#x2019;s Golden-�Domed Monastery in 1110.<br><br>There are exceptions. We know the names of hundreds of ancient Greek philosophers, from Acrion to Zeno, as well as a few Greek engineers of the same period, such as Eupalinos, Philo, and Ctesibius. We also know of a number of Chinese artists from around 400 c.e. onward, including the calligrapher Wei Shuo and her student Wang Xizhi. But the general principle holds. Broadly speaking, our knowledge of who created what started around the middle of the thirteenth century, increased during the European Renaissance of the fourteenth to seventeenth centuries, and has kept increasing ever since. The reasons for the change are complicated and the subject of debate among historians&#x2014;�they include power struggles within the churches of Europe, the rise of science, and the rediscovery of ancient philosophy&#x2014;�but there is little doubt that most creators started getting credit for their creations only after the year 1200.<br><br>One way this happened was through patents, which give credit within rigorous constraints. The first patents were issued in Italy in the fifteenth century, in Britain and the United States in the seventeenth century, and in France in the eighteenth century. The modern U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted its first patent on July 31, 1790. It granted its eight millionth patent on August 16, 2011. The patent office does not keep records of how many different people have been granted patents, but economist Manuel Trajtenberg developed a way of working it out. He analyzed names phonetically and compared matches with zip codes, coinventors, and other information to identify each unique inventor. Trajtenberg&#x2019;s data suggests that more than six million distinct individuals had received U.S. patents by the end of 2011.<br><br>The inventors are not distributed evenly across the years. Their numbers are increasing. The first million inventors took 130 years to get their patents, the second million 35 years, the third million 22 years, the fourth million 17 years, the fifth million 10 years, and the sixth million inventors took 8 years. Even with foreign inventors removed and adjustments for population increase, the trend is unmistakable. In 1800, about one in every 175,000 Americans was granted a first patent. In 2000, one in every 4,000 Americans received one.<br><br>Not all creations get a patent. Books, songs, plays, movies, and other works of art are protected by copyright instead, which in the United States is managed by the Copyright Office, part of the Library of Congress. Copyrights show the same growth as patents. In 1870, 5,600 works were registered for copyright. In 1886, the number grew to more than 31,000, and Ainsworth Spofford, the librarian of Congress, had to plead for more space. &#x201c;Again it becomes necessary to refer to the difficulty and embarrassment of prosecuting the annual enumeration of the books and pamphlets recently completed,&#x201d; he wrote in a report to Congress. &#x201c;Each year and each month adds to the painfully overcrowded condition of the collections, and although many rooms have been filled with the overflow from the main Library, the difficulty of handling so large an accumulation of unshelved books is constantly growing.&#x201d; This became a refrain. In 1946, register of copyrights Sam Bass Warner reported that &#x201c;the number of registrations of copyright claims rose to 202,144 the greatest number in the history of the Copyright Office, and a number so far beyond the capacities of the existing staff that Congress, responding to the need, generously provided for additional personnel.&#x201d; In 1991, copyright registrations reached a peak of more than 600,000. As with patents, the increase exceeded population growth. In 1870, there was 1 copyright registration for every 7,000 U.S. citizens. In 1991, there was one copyright registration for every 400 U.S. citizens.<br><br>More credit is given for creation in science, too. The Science Citation Index tracks the world&#x2019;s leading peer-�reviewed journals in science and technology. For 1955, the index lists 125,000 new scientific papers&#x2014;�about 1 for every 1,350 U.S. citizens. For 2005, it lists more than 1,250,000 scientific papers&#x2014;�one for every 250 U.S. citizens.<br><br>Patents, copyrights, and peer-�reviewed papers are imperfect proxies. Their growth is driven by money...</p><h2>A Scent of Champagne: 8,000 Champagnes Tested and Rated</h2><p><b>A luxury volume on the world's most elegant beverage--by world renowned champagne expert Richard Juhlin, with an introduction by �douard Cointreau</b><br><br>In this beautiful and heavily illustrated volume&nbsp; the world's foremost&nbsp; champagne expert, Richard Juhlin takes the reader on a journey to the geographical area of Champagne and through the history of the beverage.

In fact, he continues teaching the Bible on nearly every continent with his wife, Jill. Stuart served as senior pastor of Elmbrook Church for thirty years and under his leadership, the church grew exponentially. Stuart&#39;s sermons are heard daily by an international audience through the media ministry, Telling the Truth. He has written more than forty books, received three honorary doctorates and is a popular speaker throughout the world.Taking God Seriously is a book that provides a refreshing window into twelve books of the Old Testament that are practically unknown by most Christians.

Nina Reilly is a tough, tenderhearted, and unpredictable Lake Tahoe attorney with a one-woman practice, a young son, a genuine sense of humor, and an interesting love life. Now, in <b>Breach of Promise</b><i>,</i> Nina takes on the biggest case of her career, a high-profile, high-stakes palimony suit that could make her millions or ruin her financially. Little does she suspect that it will place her dead center in a bizarre and perplexing murder investigation.<br><br>At glitzy Lake Tahoe, couples break up every day, but none quite so glamorous or successful as Lindy and Mike Markov. The scenario starts off in the standard way: Mike's met a younger woman and wants out. The problem? Mike and Lindy built a $200-million business together and Mike claims he doesn't owe Lindy a dime since they never married.<br><br>Ready to fight, Lindy hires Nina Reilly to represent her in her palimony suit. Lacking the resources to handle a case with stakes this high, Nina hires an expert litigator in palimony law, who in turn brings in a jury consultant to ensure that the makeup of the jury is to their advantage. Now Nina's working with a desperate, unstable client and slick big-city legal professionals on the kind of case&#x2014;full of passion, raw emotion, and explosive secrets--that could make a fortune for a struggling lawyer. Or drive someone to commit a shocking murder&#x2014;for love, money. . . or the right verdict.<br><br>With all of the storytelling power, authentic legal detail, and insight into the dark recesses of the human heart that have made her the hottest woman writer of legal thrillers, Perri O'Shaughnessy takes readers into the courtroom and far beyond it in her latest masterpiece of legal suspense.</p><p>Fans who have been eagerly awaiting the next installment in the Nina Reilly series won't be disappointed by Perri O'Shaughnessy's latest, <i>Breach of Promise</i>. The creator of <i>Invasion of Privacy</i> and <i>Obstruction of Justice</i> has crafted a tale of love and murder gone awry in the material age.<p> Palimony--birds do it, bees do it, Liberace's heirs do it, and so do Mike and Lindy Markov. When Mike falls for Rachel, a young and beautiful vice president at Markov Enterprises, he tells Lindy (his companion and business partner of many years) that their relationship is over, leaving her, in effect, to go soak her head in one of the Markov Super Spas they've invented and sold to countless arthritics. Desperate to retain her fair share of their $250 million fortune, Lindy hires Nina to pursue a palimony suit against Mike, tempting her with an enormous percentage if they win their case.</p><p> O'Shaughnessy thus leads into the deceptively simple, deeply disturbing philosophical conundrum around which she weaves her tale of intrigue: What would you--what would anyone--do for money? As Nina pursues her case, O'Shaughnessy tests the boundaries of traditional courtroom-drama fiction by playing with the conventions of narrative form, but she remains true to the genre's ethic of devious surprises and fast-paced action.</p><p> Granted, Nina is a lawyer rather than a private investigator, and her smooth style bears little resemblance to, say, the sardonic goofiness of Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone, but she may strike a chord with fans of Sara Paretsky's Chicago sleuth, V.I. Warshawski. Both Nina and V.I. cling stubbornly to their independence and sense of fairness as they wage battle against institutionalized forces of greed; and both O'Shaughnessy and Paretsky use engaging characters, tight plotting, and clever dialogue to lure their readers into wrestling with legal and moral dilemmas. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>Early praise for <i>Breach of Promise:</i><p>"O'Shaughnessy offers up a gripping courtroom drama...all packed into a riveting story that will hold readers--especially fans of Grisham and Turow--spellbound."<br><i>--Booklist</i></p><p>Praise for Perri O'Shaughnessy's previous Nina Reilly novels:</p><p><i>Motion to Suppress:</i></p><p>"A real puzzler, with twists diabolical enough to take to court." <br><i>--The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p><i>Invasion of Privacy:</i></p><p>"[A] . . . deft, multileveled tale of legal and criminal treachery." <br><i>--Publishers Weekly</i></p><p><i>Obstruction of Justice:</i></p><p>"Nina Reilly is one of the most interesting heroines in legal thrillers today."<br><i>--San Jose Mercury News</i></p></p><h2>The Mackenzie Family: Mackenzie&#39;s Pleasure and Mackenzie&#39;s Magic</h2><p>Navy SEAL Zane Mackenzie finds both danger and romance when he rescues an ambassador&#39;s lovely daughter from terrorist kidnappers in Mackenzie&#39;s Pleasure, while in Mackenzie&#39;s Magic, Maris Mackenzie joins forces with a dashing FBI agent to probe the disappearance of a prize horse.

The `poet&#39;s poet&#39;, he has a place in the national pantheon and, more tangibly, a plaque in Westminster Abbey&#39;s Poets&#39; Corner, unveiled in 1989. Here at last is Clare&#39;s full story, from his birth in poverty and employment as an agricultural labourer, via his burgeoning promise as a writer - cultivated under the gaze of rival patrons - and moment of fame, in the company of John Keats, as the toast of literary London, to his final decline into mental illness and the last years of his life, confined in asylums. Clare&#39;s ringing voice - quick-witted, passionate, vulnerable, courageous - emerges through extracts from his letters, journals, autobiographical writings and poems, as Jonathan Bate brings this complex man, his revered work and his ribald world, vividly to life.</p><p>Jonathan Bate, born in 1958, has edited Arden Shakespeare editions and is author of The Genius of Shakespeare, Song of the Earth and a novel, The Cure for Love. He writes regularly for the Telegraph, TLS and Independent and often appears on radio and TV. He lives in the Wirral with his wife and son.<p> John Clare (1793-1864), who was born in the village of Helpston, Northamptonshire, in the eastern flatlands of England, found his poetry in the woods and fields, in the intricate nests of birds and the avid renewal of wildflowers, in "a language that is ever green." He was enabled by what he read -- James Thompson's poem "The Seasons" inspired him to become a poet -- and often wandered through the fields with a book jammed in his pocket. "The fields were our church," he later recalled, "and we seemed to feel a religious feeling in our haunts on the sabbath." A secular religious sensibility -- "the quiet love of nature's presence" -- animates his work, early and late.</p><p> Jonathan Bate's capacious and detailed new book, John Clare: A Biography (Farrar Straus Giroux, $40), tells the story of England's greatest working-class poet with deep sympathy and understanding. It is published simultaneously with a splendid selected poems that demonstrates the complete range of Clare's achievement, which is no mean feat since he wrote more than 3,500 poems over a 35-year period. The punctuation is a bit too regularized for my taste -- Clare was a madcap and eccentric punctuator at best -- but the trade-off in literal accuracy does give the poems fuller accessibility to a wider audience. He breathes in these pages.</p><p> Clare was "addicted" to poetry, helpless before his rural muse. He was an agricultural laborer, who published four poetry books during his lifetime, containing less than one-quarter of his total output. He was taken up as a "peasant poet" in London, supported by rival patrons, cultivated, condescended to, neglected. He was dogged by poverty most of his life. He had a keen ear for the vernacular and championed local customs, yet was considered "peculiar" by his neighbors. He stuck out everywhere -- an alien at home, a lonely visionary. He empathized with outsiders, such as gypsies, whom he characterized as "a quiet, pilfering, unprotected race." It is no wonder, then, that shy, vulnerable creatures especially called to him -- the snipe, the marten, the badger, the field-mouse.</p><p> Clare was a prodigious walker, a solitary who sought out the secret recesses of nature, a hidden, underappreciated, overlooked country, which he detailed with a sharp eye and a naturalist's sensibility. Accuracy was a scrupulous habit, a moral imperative. He had a powerful capacity to identify with what he observed. Bate points out that more than 50 of Clare's poems begin "I love." "Poets love nature and themselves are love," he wrote in a late sonnet. "For everything I felt a love,/ The weeds below, the birds above," he declared in "The Progress of Rhyme." Bate also notes that the most common noun in Clare's mature poetry is "joy." One distinguishing feature of Clare's work is the ethic of reciprocity that he brought to his encounters with the natural world.</p><p> Clare's poetry intimately chronicles a world that was rapidly disappearing, that was systematically divided up into rectangular plots of land, fenced off and restricted, enclosed. This gives particular social and political relevance to his highly personal first subject, the lost Eden of childhood, a world that he never forgot but that seemed to abandon him. It also gives additional poignancy to his love poems, which are typically invitations: "Let us go in the fields, love, and see the green tree;/ Let's go in the meadows and hear the wild bee;/ There's plenty of pleasure for you, love, and me/ In the mirth and the music of nature."</p><p>We'll down the green meadow and up the lone glen </p><p>And down the woodside far away from all men, </p><p>And there we'll talk over our love-tales again </p><p> Where last year the nightingale sung.</p><p> He loved to roam so freely through open fields, through wilds and waste places, through uncultivated regions, that it comes as something of a shock to find him suddenly looking back over his shoulder for magistrates and gamekeepers.</p><p> </p><p>I dreaded walking where there was no path </p><p>And pressed with cautious tread the meadow swath </p><p>And always turned to look with wary eye </p><p>And always feared the owner coming by;</p><p>Yet everything about where I had gone </p><p>Appeared so beautiful I ventured on </p><p>And when I gained the road where all are free </p><p>I fancied every stranger frowned at me </p><p>And every kinder look appeared to say </p><p>"You've been on trespass in your walk today."</p><p>I've often thought, the day appeared so fine, </p><p>How beautiful if such a place were mine;</p><p>But, having naught, I never feel alone </p><p>And cannot use another's as my own.</p><p>Clare was alert both to social and economic alienation. E. P. Thompson recognized that "Clare may be described, without hindsight, as a poet of ecological protest: he was not writing about man here and nature there, but lamenting a threatened equilibrium in which both were involved."</p><p>He suffered from a disconcerting number of physical and mental troubles. Bate scrupulously chronicles the tormented years from 1837 to 1864 that the poet spent in the High Beach Asylum and the Northampton General Lunatic Asylum. He suggests that Clare "conforms to the classic pattern . . . of manic depression or 'bipoloar affective disorder,' " though in the end concludes that he was most likely schizophrenic. He had periods of lucidity mixed with bouts of depression and episodes of mania. He was emotionally volatile. He suffered from delusions and obsessively identified himself with Lord Byron. One of his strangest literary performances is "Don Juan: A Poem," which begins, " 'Poets are born' -- and so are whores -- the trade is/ Grown universal."</p><p> Clare was also gripped by the notion that he had two wives. One was his actual wife, the other his youthful crush and early muse, Mary Joyce. "To Mary" begins:</p><p>I sleep with thee and wake with thee </p><p>And yet thou are not there;</p><p>I fill my arms with thoughts of thee </p><p>And press the common air.</p><p>Thy eyes are gazing upon mine </p><p>When thou art out of sight;</p><p>My lips are always touching thine </p><p>At morning, noon and night.</p><p>Clare continued writing all through his asylum years: "I wrote because it pleased me in sorrow," he said, "and when I am happy it makes me more happy and so I go on."</p><p> Some of Clare's finest works were asylum poems: "A Vision," "An Invite to Eternity," a poem addressed to his namesake, and two disconsolate self-revelations that begin "I am," one a sonnet ("I feel I am -- I only know I am"), the other a lyric that stands as his most haunting memorial, a poem with a simple eloquence, a shocking lucidity.</p><p> </p><p>Lines: "I Am"</p><p>I am -- yet what I am, none cares or knows;</p><p>My friends forsake me like a memory lost:</p><p>I am the self-consumer of my woes -- </p><p>They rise and vanish in oblivion's host </p><p>Like shadows in love-frenzied stifled throes -- </p><p>And yet I am and live -- like vapours tossed </p><p>Into the nothingness of scorn and noise, </p><p>Into the living sea of waking dreams </p><p>Where there is neither sense of life or joys </p><p>But the vast shipwreck of my life's esteems;</p><p>Even the dearest that I love the best </p><p>Are strange -- nay, rather, stranger than the rest.</p><p>I long for scenes where man hath never trod, </p><p>A place where woman never smiled or wept, </p><p>There to abide with my Creator, God, </p><p>And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept, </p><p>Untroubling and untroubled where I lie, </p><p>The grass below -- above, the vaulted sky.</p><p> </p><p>By Edward Hirsch </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

After graduating from Sacred Heart H. S. he spent two years in the U.S. Army. In 1962, after several Teamster Union trucking jobs, he joined the NYPD. He spent nine years in uniform walking the streets of the South Bronx, while earning a BA at Fordham University. During the last eleven years he supervised detectives in the Organized Crime Control Bureau. Ed retired from the NYPD as a lieutenant lugging a suitcase full of stories he had to write. He left Fordham Law School to obtain a MFA in Creative Writing at Arizona State University. His master&#39;s thesis became his first novel. Although the horror and hilarity of his NYPD career are evident in his work, Ed focuses on the cops themselves; how the depressing grind of an impossible job infects and changes them, then spills over onto those they love. Ed has two daughters and four grandchildren. He lives in Delaware with his wife, Nancy who made the frying pan-to-fire leap of cop&#39;s wife to writer&#39;s wife.Fast-paced, gritty, funny, this is an absorbing tour of some of New York City's meanest streets. Middle-aged NYPD detective Anthony Ryan, who narrates, and his partner, Joe Gregory, get the case of a murdered off-duty cop whose slashed, semi-clothed body suggests the work of a hooker. The investigation takes the pair from the Bronx to Times Square and beyond as they encounter drug dealers, topless dancers, crazies, transvestites and citizens of every other stripe. Ryan himself is a terrific character, fretting over his wife's diabetes, trying to understand his oft-married daughter, worrying about his partner's drinking (and his own), working at accepting the wildly diverse New Yorkers he meets and salting his narration with street smarts galore, from asides about the best routes through the city and the timing of traffic lights to the observation that it's "impossible to find an unexplored trash can in this economy." As Ryan and Gregory turn over the city's cobblestones, not unexpected culprits slither out: crooked cops, heroin, greed-but the ending takes an odd, bittersweet bounce that's just right for this especially satisfying and savvy cop tale.

He was an ardent member of the Hitler Youth. This is the story of their parallel journey through World War II.<p>Helen Waterford and Alfons Heck were born just a few miles from each other in the German Rhineland. But their lives took radically different courses: Helen's to the Auschwitz extermination camp; Alfons to a high rank in the Hitler Youth.</p><p>While Helen was hiding in Amsterdam, Alfons was a fanatic believer in Hitler's "master race". While she was crammed in a cattle car bound for the death camp Auschwitz, he was a teenage commander of frontline troops, ready to fight and die for the glory of Hitler and the Fatherland. This book tells both of their stories, side-by-side, in an overwhelming account of the nightmare that was WWII. The riveting stories of these two remarkable people must stand as a powerful lesson to us all.</p>Grade 7 Up?This is a book to make your blood run cold. Through Ayer's narrative and excerpts from Heck's memoirs, A Child of Hitler and The Burden of Hitler's Legacy, readers learn how Alfons changed from a loving, wholesome boy to a "Nazi devil" (even the Germans called the elite Hitler Youth by that name). It is frightening to see how easily young people can be swayed, and readers learn just how it happened. Alternating chapters reveal Helen Waterford's story through excerpts from her book, Commitment to the Dead, and Ayer's background material. Fleeing with her fiancee to Amsterdam after Kristallnacht, Helen was again caught in the Nazi noose and struggled to survive. As her plight grew more desperate, Alfons rose higher and higher in the Hitler Youth. Eventually, when he and his ragged corps faced annihilation by the Russians, he realized how Hitler had sacrificed his "children." When Alfons and Helen met in the U.S. 40 years after the war, they found that they shared a common purpose: to help young people understand that peace and compassion are possible between individuals, and on a larger scale as well. Their first-person accounts are interwoven with Ayer's words so seamlessly that readers are unaware of the intrusion of a third person. She is an excellent biographer, capturing nuances of her subjects' characters and personality traits. A fascinating work.?Marcia W.

The treasure trove promises to shed unprecedented light on the most mysterious period of British history&#x2014;the so-called "Dark Ages"&#x2014;when the Saxons, Anglos, Celts, Picts, Jutes, and Vikings battled for control of the British Isles and a "mish mash of peoples evolved into a homogenous nation possessed with a strong cultural identity," according to <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the book, Caroline Alexander.<br> &nbsp;<br> Alexander, author of the bestselling <i>The Endurance</i> and <i>The Bounty,</i> draws themes from the story of the spectacular treasure to explore the entire fascinating history of the Saxons in England; from the fall of Rome to the flourishing and seemingly incomprehensible spread of Saxon influence. Piece by piece, she draws readers into a world of near constant warfare guided by a unique understanding of Christianity, blended as it was with pagan traditions. Through heroic and epic literature that survives in poems such as Beowulf and the Legends of King Arthur, Alexander seeks to separate myth from reality and wonder, with readers, if the circumstances of the deposit of such a spectacular hoard have parallels in legendary tales. Peering through a millennia of mist and mystery, Alexander reveals a fascinating era&#x2014;and a mesmerizing discovery&#x2014;as never before, uncovering a dynamic period of history that would see its conclusion in the birth of the English nation.<br> &nbsp;<br> Set in a landscape whose beauty endures, the story of the making of England emerges through a wealth of archaeological and written material. The story highlights the fluid nature of human societies and carries a surprisingly modern message of a successful, cohesive culture emerging from a diverse group of peoples.</p><p>Caroline Alexander is the bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Endurance, The Bounty,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The War That Killed Achilles,&nbsp;</i>and is widely recognized for her nonfiction writing.

One of the painters who achieved remarkable fame in the eighties-and one of the few to sustain his reputation-Clemente rarely gives interviews and dislikes being photographed. But when his dear friend Babini asked if he would let himself be photographed informally, on a day-to-day basis, Clemente agreed in the name of friendship and collaboration.<br><br>Since then, Babini has compiled an intimate and beautiful chronicle of Clemente's life and work. Francesco Clemente: Art and Life shows the artist in his studio-in New York, Amalfi, Taos, and Madras. This photographic record of Clemente's working process is as extraordinary as it is enlightening.<br><br>Poet and arts writer Rene Ricard traces the evolution of the artist's studio through time, while simultaneously acting as a contemporary Giorgio Vasari in his more personal discussion of Clemente, his art, and his life. The first book of its kind, Babini's photo journal will be published in conjunction with the retrospective of Francesco Clemente's work at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City in the fall of 1999.<br></p><p>Francesco Clemente, who enlivened the New York art scene in the 1980s along with a handful of other image-conscious Italians, including Sandra Chia, is said to be a reclusive artist who guards his privacy, but this richly informative book makes that assertion difficult to believe. Clemente himself has always offered a good deal of autobiography to his viewers, with works that have explored his own visage (and other parts) with relentless interest and introspection. And now comes <i>Francesco Clemente</i>, filled with intimate pictures shot by his friend Luca Babini in Clemente studios from New York to New Mexico to Naples. Packed to bursting, the photographs show Clemente working away, with wife, kids, and dogs in tow. With its pictorial richness--paint-spattered floors, trampled rags, stacked canvases, raw-edged, unstretched paintings stapled to huge walls, encrusted studio shoes, and scores of photographs of works in progress--this book will be devoured by other artists, who will turn the pages in a lather of envy, not necessarily for Clemente's fame and success, but for the huge windows and high ceilings of his various work spaces. <p> Clemente is a fecund artist, and there are many wonderful shots of his art--whole walls and tables full of it--that make a succinct statement correlating productivity and achievement. Clemente has contributed a kind of prose poem for the first part of the book, in which he discusses being a painter, and there is also a rambling essay by art writer Rene Ricard on artists' studios from ancient Egypt to the Renaissance. But the pictures are the point of this book, and they handsomely reward the reader's attention. They constitute an invitation to spend time--years, in fact--with a painter whose inventiveness, ambition, and style have made him one of the most successful of his time. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p>Luca Babini, a well-known photographer and filmmaker, lives in New York City.</p><h2>Athenian red figure vases: The archaic period : a handbook (The World of art)</h2><p>In his sequel to &#34;Athenian Black Figure Vases, &#34; John Boardman, Professor Emeritus at Oxford University, covers the invention of the &#34;red figure&#34; technique in about 530 BC.

En route, she meets the dashing and handsome James Lindsay, a midshipman and painter on the ship who is really a duke. They fall in love, and Mary is torn between marrying him and beginning a new life in England, or returning to America to her father and the island farm she has loved all her life. Strong feelings for one's family heritage are clearly evoked through the heroine's first-person narrative. Mary is an independent and courageous character, especially on her voyage to England, where she proves herself to be an excellent sailor. Vivid descriptions of Michilmackinac and its simple beauty juxtaposed with crowded, cosmopolitan England create a strong sense of both locales. Mary's hard-working existence on her farm is also juxtaposed with the rigors of tradition and proper behavior in English society. Adventure, romance, and history blend nicely to create a well-rounded story that cries for yet another sequel.<br><i>Janet Gillen, Great Neck Public Library, NY</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ever After</h2><p>Signed by the author, 1st edition.

Burgess</h2><p>Thirty years have passed since the 1975 publication of Robert H. Burgess&#39;s classic Chesapeake Sailing Craft, and while the original edition of this book has been out of print for many years, this new expanded edition brings alive the author&#39;s photographs and recollections for a new generation of readers. Within these pages, Burgess presents a rare photographic record of the period 1925� &#34;1975, depicting the bay sailing craft from log canoe to four-masted schooner. Robert H. Burgess&#39;s photographs show the vessels in all phases of their activities on these waters, including loading and unloading cargoes, under sail and in port, in shipyards, details of rigging, fittings, and decks, interior views, as powerboats, and abandoned hulks. No one has so thoroughly photographed the Chesapeake sailing vessels as Burgess. He applied himself to the task as though he were getting paid for it. But it was purely through a feeling for the history of the bay and its craft, an awareness that a change was taking place, that he pursued his subject so persistently. If he had not undertaken this labor of love, most of the sailing vessels in this volume would have passed on with no photographic record of their ever having existed. This edition showcases the original text, photos, and captions and adds 150 new photos with captions by William A. Fox. The result is Chesapeake Sailing Craft: Recollections of Robert H. Burgess, a new and expanded edition of the original volume for bay enthusiasts to enjoy. As in the original edition, all the photos in this book were taken by Robert Burgess. They appear as he saw them through the viewfinder of his camera and as he printed them in the darkroom, uncropped and unretouched.</p><p>There is scarcely a river, creek, or slough in the Chesapeake Bay Country that Robert H. Burgess (1913-2003) did not explore with his camera. Known to many as Dean of the Chesapeake, Robert &#34;Bob&#34; Burgess knew the Chesapeake Bay in its older, more primitive, and pleasant way of life. He saw the era of commercial sail and steam fading and undertook to document and preserve bay watercraft through photography. Without this labor of love, most of the sailing vessels in his book would have passed on with no photographic record of their existence. Baltimore-born, Burgess joined the staff of the Mariners&#39; Museum in Newport News in 1941, where he became curator of exhibits and was later named curator of publications. He was a member of the Steamship Historical Society of America, on the Board of Governors of the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, and a trustee of the Calvert Marine Museum and Chesapeake Bay Foundation. In 2000, The Chesapeake Maritime Museum presented Robert H. Burgess the coveted Chesapeake Bay Heritage Award in recognition of &#34;his significant contributions to the preservation of the cultural and maritime heritage of the Chesapeake Bay.&#34; Among his legacies are the many articles and books about the Chesapeake Bay and its craft, illustrated with his photographs. His photos are widely recognized for their documentary and artistic quality. Naval architect William A. Fox was born in Newport News, Virginia, at the height of the World War II shipbuilding program. He grew up in Newport News and owes his interest in maritime history to his mother, Katherine Johnson Fox, who worked at the Mariners&#39; Museum library, and to his father, Erwin A. Fox, Jr., who was a merchant mariner, shipbuilder, and boater. William A. Fox graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute in 1965 and received his master&#39;s degree in Urban Studies from Old Dominion University in 1979. He has worked for Newport News Shipbuilding; for Esso (Exxon) International in New York, Italy, and Spain; and for Stanwick International in Iran. Since 1979 he has been associated with John J. McMullen Associates in Newport News. He began his writing career with a book chapter on ship modeling in 1975, and a history of the tug Dorothy (Newport News Hull No. 1) in 1976. In 1986 he researched and wrote Always Good Ships, a comprehensive history of all of the ships built at the Newport News shipyard since its founding in 1886. He has contributed many articles on maritime history to magazines and newspapers, and has edited several books including Chesapeake Sailing Craft.</p><h2>Mangia Pasta</h2><p>When it comes to pasta, Mary Ann Esposito knows how to satisfy the heartiest of eaters.

She lives in Warsaw, Poland.Gr 2&#x2013;4&#x2014;Dr. Esperanto, the pseudonym of L. L. Zamenhof, comes out of deep obscurity in this intriguing picture book biography. Growing up in Poland, Zamenhof spoke several languages. While he graduated from medical school and practiced as an opthamologist, his passion was creating a universal language so everyone could understand one another and live in harmony. The story deftly explains Zamenhof's attempts to create Esperanto. It also delves into his father's lack of encouragement. The story ends on a positive note, with Zamenhof joining a hopeful international conference on Esperanto in Paris. A page explaining why the language might be beneficial is appended. Further biographical information is also included. This is a true picture book, with no index. The text is fairly brief. Softly colored cartoon illustrations show various, mostly European cultures. The overall feeling is warm and optimistic. This is an inspiring story of determination and hope. VERDICT Recommended in part because there are no other books about Esperanto or Zamenhof for this grade range. Especially useful for adults interested in the language who want to share their enthusiasm with their students or children in their lives.&#x2014;Anne Chapman Callaghan, Racine Public Library, WI</p><h2>Stepping Stone / Love Machine (Crosstown to Oblivion)</h2><p>The best-selling author of the Easy Rawlins mysteries presents a two-in-one omnibus of stories that explores life&#39;s cosmic questions, from the meaning of life to the nature of good and evil, from the perspectives of individuals who are given unique insights that are largely inaccessible to the rest of the world. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>WALTER MOSLEY is one of the most versatile and admired writers in America today.

KIM,</i>&#x201d; Dr. Marchant Lewis said.<br>Lois frowned slightly and then lowered herself into the chair he indicated.<br>Lewis was clad in a crisp white doctor&#x2019;s smock that was at least two sizes too small for his great girth. Small plastic buttons strained to hold the garment across his belly. In the spaces between Lois could see the black T-shirt he wore.<br>When the big man looked down on Lois she shuddered inwardly.<br>Marchant smiled.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be nervous,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t hurt.&#x201d;<br>With some effort, he walked around the table and took the seat across from her. As he wedged himself in a button popped off and struck Lois on the cheek.<br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; she cried, half rising from her chair.<br>&#x201c;Sit down, Lois,&#x201d; he commanded in that rumbling low voice.<br>Lois regained her self-control and sat back.<br>On the table between them sat a sleek, silvery box about the size of the multimedia player that Lois had bought just that week. In the center of the glittering box was a red rectangular button, that was half the size of a matchbook and lit from underneath. Marchant depressed the button with a thick finger and two square plates shot out from either side, one for Marchant and the other for Lois. Each plate had a shallow, hand-shaped depression covering the most part of its surface area.<br>Marchant smiled and placed a mitt on his template. He indicated with a glance and a hand gesture that she should do the same with hers.<br>&#x201c;Am I supposed to put my hand here?&#x201d; she asked, stalling.<br>Marchant nodded. The fat of his face, Lois thought, made him look more like a grotesque baby than a grown man.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s supposed to happen?&#x201d; she asked with hardly a tremor in her voice.<br>&#x201c;Exactly what I proposed to InterCyb,&#x201d; Lewis said. &#x201c;Through a noninvasive electronic medium I will be able to map the complete neuronal system of your hand, gauging the flow of stimuli with absolute accuracy.&#x201d;<br>Kim stared at the colossus opposite her. She was made nervous, she knew, merely because of his size. Marchant Lewis was nearly seven feet tall and weighed, she&#x2019;d been told by her boss, Ryan Lippmann, over five hundred pounds.<br>Big men had always frightened Lois&#x2014;ever since childhood. But she knew that her fears were unfounded superstitions based on her own size and the bedtime stories her grandmother had told her when Lois visited her in Korea Town. The stories always had ogres that were as big as houses with obscene genitals and fingernails like claws&nbsp;... <br>But those stories were for children.<br>Marchant Lewis was no ogre. He was the top neurophysicist in the nation; maybe in the entire world. The thesis for his Ph.D. from MIT was the complete mapping of the memory systems of pigeons, a revolutionary achievement for any biophysicist, comparable to the greatest scientific accomplishments in history. It was a coup for InterCybernetics International when Lois brokered the deal to hire him away from the government. She had to trust him; her future depended on the success of this man.<br>But still she hesitated.<br>&#x201c;What will happen?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your hand will be drawn in and the Datascriber will begin its work.&#x201d; Something about Lewis&#x2019;s smile seemed threatening or maybe it was just that Lois could tell that he knew something that she did not.<br>&#x201c;Will it hurt?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I sincerely doubt it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t really see why I have to do this,&#x201d; Lois said, trying to keep the whine out of her voice.<br>&#x201c;Somebody from management has to,&#x201d; Marchant replied. &#x201c;This technology is about tactile sensation. How can you justify the millions that you&#x2019;ve put into my work if one of you doesn&#x2019;t test it?&#x201d;<br>Her hands clenched firmly together in her lap Lois Kim said, &#x201c;That is precisely why I&#x2019;m here, Dr. Lewis. Your method of farming out work to different unaffiliated labs makes it very difficult for us to judge your work&#x2014;and its cost analysis.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t judge without putting your hand on the template, Ms. Kim.&#x201d;<br>There was nothing else for her to say. She&#x2019;d put off this meeting for a month already and her boss was e-mailing her daily now wondering, forcefully, <i>What is happening with the Lewis project?</i> It was Labor Day Friday and she had plans with Grant, her boyfriend, to leave for Death Valley that afternoon.<br>Cautiously she laid her hand upon the template.<br>&#x201c;Let the weight of your hand rest on it, dear,&#x201d; the older man said.<br>The moment she let her forearm relax straps shot out from both sides of the plate looping and tightening over her hand, securing palm and fingers to the form made for them.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d; Lois said, the hysteria fully formed in her words.<br>&#x201c;Your hand has to be held completely motionless or the Datascriber won&#x2019;t work. Relax, Ms. Kim. There&#x2019;s absolutely nothing to worry about.&#x201d;<br>While Marchant Lewis spoke Lois felt the insistent tug of the template pan as her hand was drawn into the silver box. She could feel her heart throbbing like that of a small, frightened animal. It was hard for her to catch her breath. A warm, viscous liquid oozed between her fingers.<br>Lois was ready to scream when she had the vision.<br>There was a long and very wide plain of green that spread out for what seemed to be many miles in front of her. This plain went on and on until it slammed into a slate-blue sky. A fluttering of red boomed above her head. She knew somewhere in a faraway place that this was just a redbird suddenly frightened and taken to wing. But in her heart this was an amazing event not unlike when the Lord spoke and life sprang from nothingness.<br>&#x201c;Marky,&#x201d; a woman&#x2019;s voice called. &#x201c;Marky.&#x201d;<br>Lois cried for joy at the redbird and her mother&#x2019;s call.<br><i>Mama never called me Marky,</i> the distant thought chimed. But Lois didn&#x2019;t care. She pressed her hands upon the green, green grass feeling every spiky blade against her tender palms. She heaved herself up making it to a wide-legged stance. A street appeared between the lawn and sky and a big maroon car zoomed past. Lois took in a deep breath hearing the growl of the car&#x2019;s engine and her own breath simultaneously. She blew at the automobile&#x2019;s red brake lights as it got smaller and quieter. She laughed&#x2014;exultant at her own power.<br><i>Cars move due to the internal combustion engine,</i> the faraway mind intoned.<br>&#x201c;Marky,&#x201d; Mother called from what seemed like very far away.<br>Lois spun around so quickly that she lost her balance and fell back onto the grass. The sudden motion of her body, the jumble of sky and green and street made for a joyous confusion that brought her to the edge of fear.<br>But then two huge black hands folded around her sides and Lois was suddenly like that redbird flapping her arms and legs in flight.<br>The broad brown-black face&#x2014;Mama(?)&#x2014;smiled, showing hungry teeth. Lois felt her bowels clench but she wasn&#x2019;t embarrassed by the sensation.<br>&#x201c;Marky,&#x201d; the Woman said again.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a beautiful boy,&#x201d; a deep voice boomed.<br>The Man standing next to the Woman scared and amazed Lois. This wasn&#x2019;t Dada but still he kissed the Woman. He tried to do the same to Lois but she reared and slapped his big wet lips.<br>&#x201c;Benny&#x2019;s a friend, Marky,&#x201d; the Woman said but Lois let fly a stream of curses that came out as one long unintelligible cry. Her bowels opened up and the redbird seemed to be flapping in her chest.<br>&#x201c;Somebody needs changing,&#x201d; Mama said and the world folded into flesh and the music of only the Woman&#x2019;s voice and hands&nbsp;... <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><i>W</i><i>HEN LOIS KIM </i>opened her eyes she was still sitting across the table from Dr. Lewis. His smile was beatific and she realized, with some surprise, that he no longer frightened her. She had momentarily lost track of where she was and then, with a sudden fright, she remembered the lashes that had trapped her hand. She yanked her arm back only to see that she had already been released. She felt for the oil that had covered her fingers but her skin was completely dry.<br><i>An illusion?</i><br>As if in answer to her unasked question Marchant held up his hand showing that it was coated with thick, brightly glistening fluid.<br>&#x201c;Did you feel the oil on my hand?&#x201d; he asked in the tone of a much younger man.<br>&#x201c;Y-y-y-yes,&#x201d; she stammered. &#x201c;How did you do that?&#x201d;<br>Marchant&#x2019;s smile turned quizzical.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s hard to explain,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;As you know when nerves are excited they send an electric pulse down a conductor. This pulse transmits data that becomes the semblance of information in the brain.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I do have a degree in bioneurology, Dr. Lewis,&#x201d; Lois said. The anger she felt also elated her. She was glad to be irate. The emotion somehow anchored her inside her own feelings.<br>&#x201c;Yes, of course. That&#x2019;s why I wanted you to come and be the first to experience my little device. That&nbsp;... and other reasons too, I guess.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What other reasons?&#x201d;<br>Marchant smiled. He paused for a moment before speaking again.<br>&#x201c;My research has found that when any nerve fires a tiny fraction of energy comes free and travels out of the body. This pulse has a very specific, if weak, signature. What my Datascriber does is read this signature, magnify it ten-thousand-fold, and transmit it to the waiting cells of another.&#x201d;<br>Lois was astonished. She had expected to be presented with a binary chart mapping certain human nerve pulses and associating those excitations with general realms of sensation. It was the overall opinion of the scientific community that actual sharing of sensate experience was a...</p><h2>Spot the Mummy in the Museum: Packed with things to spot and facts to discover!</h2><p><p>Spot the Mummy at the museum and immerse yourself with historical knowledge along the way.

This tale, written in 1934, was rejected by magazines because of its vivid portrayal of the hardships of pioneer life, including the rape of Grey's heroine by a renegade Apache. A heavily edited version called <i>30,000 on the Hoof</i> was finally published in 1940, a year after the author's death. This version, completely restored by Grey's son, Loren, recounts the trials and tribulations of Arizona rancher Logan Huett, his heroic wife, Lucinda, their three sons, and a girl named Barbara, who is abandoned by wagon-train travelers and raised by the Huetts. It begins well before the turn of the century and goes on until shortly after the World War I, during which two of the Huett sons are lost. Bret Harte and Owen Wister are credited with inventing the western.

When Mrs. Rabbit beseeches her four furry children not to go into Mr. McGregor's garden, the impish Peter naturally takes this as an open invitation to create mischief. He quickly gets in over his head, when he is spotted by farmer McGregor himself. Any child with a spark of sass will find Peter's adventures remarkably familiar. And they'll see in Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail that bane of their existence: the "good" sibling who always does the right thing. One earns bread and milk and blackberries for supper, while the obstinate folly of the other warrants medicine and an early bedtime. <p> Beatrix Potter's animal stories have been a joy to generations of young readers. Her warm, playful illustrations in soft colors invite children into the world of words and flights of fancy. Once there, she gently and humorously guides readers along the path of righteousness, leaving just enough room for children to wonder if that incorrigible Peter will be back in McGregor's garden tomorrow. <i>(Ages Baby to Preschool)</i></p>Mr. McGregor has two things on his mind when he sees Peter in his garden. One is the safety of his lettuces; the other is rabbit pie. Peter was carefully told not to go into Mr. McGregor's garden, but some little bunnies have to learn things the hard way. Beatrix Potter's classic story has been lovingly placed at the center of this creative effort, and David Jorgensen has given Peter and his family wonderfully droll and expressive character and charm in his illustrations. On the accompanying audiocaasette, Meryl Streep explores all of the drame, humor, and subtlety of the narrative, and none of its potential to entertain and teach has been left untapped. Musician/composer Lyle Mays has coordinated and augmented the work of both illustrator and narrator with a score that unifies and enlivens the whole enterprise.

Yet from using arsenic, cobalt, and quicksilver to kill household infiltrators to employing the sophisticated tools of the Orkin Man, Americans have fought to eradicate the "bugs" they have learned to hate. <br><br>Inspired by the still-revolutionary theories of Rachel Carson's <i>Silent Spring</i>, James E. McWilliams argues for a more harmonious and rational approach to our relationship with insects, one that does not harm our environment and, consequently, ourselves along the way. Beginning with the early techniques of colonial farmers and ending with the modern use of chemical insecticides, McWilliams deftly shows how America's war on insects mirrors its continual struggle with nature, economic development, technology, and federal regulation. He reveals a very American paradox: the men and women who settled and developed this country sought to control the environment and achieve certain economic goals; yet their methods of agricultural expansion undermined their efforts and linked them even closer to the inexorable realities of the insect world. <br><br>As told from the perspective of the often flamboyant actors in the battle against insects, <i>American Pests</i> is a fascinating investigation into the attitudes, policies, and practices that continue to influence our behavior toward insects. Asking us to question, if not abandon, our reckless (and sometimes futile) attempts at insect control, McWilliams convincingly argues that insects, like people, have an inherent right to exist and that in our attempt to rid ourselves of insects, we compromise the balance of nature.</p><p><p>A sweeping historical account of America's losing battle with nature.</p><p> <i>CHOICE</i> Outstanding Academic Title, 2008</p></p><h2>Freeing Celibacy</h2><p><p><b>2007 Catholic Press Association Award Winner! </b></p><p>Mandatory celibacy for Latin rite Catholic priests has been the norm for almost 900 years.

Cozzens calls for a courageous response from church leaders today to initiate an open dialogue that will result in the freeing of celibacy.? Catholic Studies?Father Cozzens has produced another book in which his fresh viewpoints, his clear affection for his Church and his compassion for those he serves demand serious consideration by bishops, priests and lay readers.? St. Anthony Messenger?Mandatory celibacy for the Latin rite has been the norm for more than 900 years. Now, some inside and outside the church have questioned this tradition. To the debate comes Fr. Cozzens with his own experience of celibate life and his talent for distilling the spiritual truth of the human condition.? Crux?This is a must-read . . . Donald Cozzens?with three other important books to his credit?is becoming a leader of Roman Catholic reform. Nine brief, graceful essays about 12 pages each comprise Freeing Celibacy. It?s easy, convincing reading.? Corpus Reports?The thesis of this book is straightforward: healthy, life-giving celibacy is a charism given to relatively few people, and mandating it for all who want to be priests, whether or not they have received the charism, causes unnecessary suffering and hardships.? Church?Cozzens makes it clear from his introduction onward that he views mandatory celibacy for diocesan priests as, at best, problematic. His arguments are clear and concise. One hopes that this book will not only be read by those who already agree with him.? Church?This is an excellent resource for Catholics and others who wish to increase their understanding of the complex issues related to Church law on priestly celibacy and Cozzens? views on homosexuality in seminaries and sexual abuse perpetrated by clergy.? Writing Works?Much more effectively than other, more famous critics of priestly celibacy, Cozzens teaches as well as advocates.? Booklist?This reading regards silence and passivity as no longer acceptable for lay Catholics who want to actively participate with and in the church. . . . After reading this highly insightful and fearless author, my question stands: Do we stay ?exiled? from our own faith, or do we have a ?faith that dares to speak??? Ministry &amp; Liturgy?Cozzens seeks to free celibacy from its judicial strangehold. Celibacy is a charism freely given by the Holy Spirit, which is intended to be freely offered to God and the community. Celibacy?s charism is total radical self-giving love through life-long abstinence from sexual relations. Ironically, mandating celibacy through Church law makes celibacy an obligation for many who do not have the charism, and offers the false promise that the gift will come through obedience to the law. Can we continue to impose celibacy as a law on diocesan clergy, many of whom do not have the charism? Cozzens mounts historical, theological, and pastoral reasons why the mandate should end.? Kathleen A. Cahalan Associate Professor Saint John?s University School of Theology and Seminary ?Here is what we need to know about the relatively short history of mandatory celibacy for diocesan priests, about its nature, its giftedness, and its difficulty. Cozzens writes with directness, honesty, and respect?for celibacy, for those who attempt it, and for those who will not free it for the good of all God?s people. And we don?t need to be ordained priests to appreciate what he says and to see celibacy in a new light. This is such a fine book!? Stefanie Weisgram, O.S.B.Collection Development Librarian and Theology Bibliographer for the College of Saint Benedict/Saint John?s University and the School of Theology?Many have questioned whether there is sufficient connection between priesthood and celibacy to warrant the Roman Rite requirement that only celibates be ordained. Few, however have argued as cogently as Donald Cozzens for that requirement to be abandoned. As a Bishop from Oceania, a region where the requirement of celibacy for ordination leads to a continued dearth of priests for evangelization, pastoral care and regular celebration of the Mass, I am deeply grateful to Donald Cozzens for setting out so compellingly the arguments for an urgent review of the present discipline in the Roman Rite. Pastoral bishops arguing for a reconsideration of the present insistence that Roman Rite priests be celibates, will be both helped and heartened by Donald Cozzens admirable review of the ecclesial and pastoral value of mandatory celibacy.?Cardinal Thomas Williams Archbishop of Wellington New Zealand?This nuanced and sensitive book cries out for a serious review of mandated celibacy. With this book Father Cozzens has given a great gift to the church. Hopefully, the church will listen.? Robert S. Bennett Former Member USCCB National Review Board for the Protection of Children and Young People?Using part of the title of his last book, we can definitely say that Donald Cozzens ?dares to speak??and thank God for him and his commitment to the truth. In Freeing Celibacy he explores the theology, history, and sociology of both mandated and charismatic clerical celibacy. He looks at the reality of church governance and listens to the testimony of priests and laity. He recognizes and lauds the power and grace of the genuine charism of priestly celibacy, but celibacy merely mandated yields unnecessary problems and horrors for him. He amasses his evidence in such a compelling way that even the hierarchs may hear him: Mandated celibacy is ready for repeal!? Andrew P. Connolly Saint Francis de Sales Parish Patchogue, New York?Donald Cozzens brings a wealth of background and experience to this book?a priest for forty years, a psychologist, a theologian, a former seminary rector and professor, a well known Catholic author, and a perceptive observer of the U.S. Catholic scene. As a result he makes a clear, cogent, convincing and truly Catholic case that the charism of celibacy is a gift for the church but the obligation of priestly celibacy hinders the ministry of the church today.? Charles E. Curran Southern Methodist University Dallas, Texas?Combining history, theology, pastoral experience and sincere love for the church, Freeing Celibacy is a courageous, forward-looking bookDonald Cozzens--priest, writer, and lecturer--teaches in the religious studies department at John Carroll University.

But they must find each other, for ahead of them lies the greatest war that has ever been - and a journey to a dark place from which no one has ever returned.</p><p>From the very start of its very first scene, <i>The Amber Spyglass</i> will set hearts fluttering and minds racing. All we'll say here is that we immediately discover who captured Lyra at the end of <i>The Subtle Knife</i>, though we've yet to discern whether this individual's intent is good, evil, or somewhere in between. We also learn that Will still possesses the blade that allows him to cut between worlds, and has been joined by two winged companions who are determined to escort him to Lord Asriel's mountain redoubt. The boy, however, has only one goal in mind--to rescue his friend and return to her the alethiometer, an instrument that has revealed so much to her and to readers of <i>The Golden Compass</i> and its follow-up. Within a short time, too, we get to experience the "tingle of the starlight" on Serafina Pekkala's skin as she seeks out a famished Iorek Byrnison and enlists him in Lord Asriel's crusade: <blockquote> A complex web of thoughts was weaving itself in the bear king's mind, with more strands in it than hunger and satisfaction. There was the memory of the little girl Lyra, whom he had named Silvertongue, and whom he had last seen crossing the fragile snow bridge across a crevasse in his own island of Svalbard. Then there was the agitation among the witches, the rumors of pacts and alliances and war; and then there was the surpassingly strange fact of this new world itself, and the witch's insistence that there were many more such worlds, and that the fate of them all hung somehow on the fate of the child. </blockquote> Meanwhile, two factions of the Church are vying to reach Lyra first. One is even prepared to give a priest "preemptive absolution" should he succeed in committing mortal sin. For these tyrants, killing this girl is no less than "a sacred task." <p> In the final installment of his trilogy, Philip Pullman has set himself the highest hurdles. He must match its predecessors in terms of sheer action and originality <i>and</i> resolve the enigmas he already created. The good news is that there is no critical bad news--not that <i>The Amber Spyglass</i> doesn't contain standoffs and close calls galore. (Who would have it otherwise?) But Pullman brings his audacious revision of <i>Paradise Lost</i> to a conclusion that is both serene and devastating. In prose that is transparent yet lyrical and 3-D, the author weaves in and out of his principals' thoughts. He also offers up several additional worlds. In one, Dr. Mary Malone is welcomed into an apparently simple society. The environment of the <i>mulefa</i> (again, we'll reveal nothing more) makes them rich in consciousness while their lives possess a slow and stately rhythm. These strange creatures can, however, be very fast on their feet (or on other things entirely) when necessary. Alas, they are on the verge of dying as Dust streams out of their idyllic landscape. Will the Oxford dark-matter researcher see her way to saving them, or does this require our young heroes? And while Mary is puzzling out a cure, Will and Lyra undertake a pilgrimage to a realm devoid of all light and hope, after having been forced into the cruelest of sacrifices--or betrayals. </p><p> Throughout his galvanizing epic, Pullman sustains scenes of fierce beauty and tenderness. He also allows us a moment or two of comic respite. At one point, for instance, Lyra's mother bullies a series of ecclesiastical underlings: "The man bowed helplessly and led her away. The guard behind her blew out his cheeks with relief." Needless to say, Mrs. Coulter is as intoxicating and fluid as ever. And can it be that we will come to admire her as she plays out her desperate endgame? In this respect, as in many others, <i>The Amber Spyglass</i> is truly a book of revelations, moving from darkness visible to radiant truth. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>"The Amber Spyglass brings the intrigue of "The Golden Compass and "The Subtle Knife to a heart-stopping end, marking the final volume of His Dark Materials as the most powerful of the trilogy. <br>Along with the return of Lyra, Will, Mrs. Coulter, Lord Asriel, Dr. Mary Malone, and Iorek Byrnison the armored bear, come a host of new characters: the Mulefa, mysterious wheeled creatures with the power to see Dust; Gallivespian Lord Roke, a hand-high spymaster to Lord Asriel; and Metatron, a fierce and mighty angel. So, too, come startling revelations: the painful price Lyra must pay to walk through the land of the dead, the haunting power of Dr. Malone's amber spyglass, and the names of who will live--and who will die--for love. And all the while, war rages with the Kingdom of Heaven, a brutal battle that--in its shocking outcome--will uncover the secret of Dust. Philip Pullman deftly brings the cliff-hangers and mysteries of His Dark Materials to an earthshattering conclusion--and confirms his fantasy trilogy as an undoubted and enduring classic.</p><h2>You Can Change the World: The Global Citizen&#39;s Handbook for Living on Planet Earth</h2><p>You Can Change the World: The Global Citizen&#39;s Handbook for Living on Planet Earth should be required reading for anyone who cares about the future of the planet. Written by renowned scientist, futurist and Club of Budapest founder Ervin Laszlo, You Can Change the World answers two pertinent questions-first, what is at the root of all the conflict and crisis in today&#39;s world? And second, what can actually be done to move toward a world where we can live in peace, without marginalizing and killing each other and destroying the environment?A handbook that urges readers to become global citizens who aspire to live responsibly on this precious but highly exploited and crisis-prone planet, You Can Change the World provides a simple and basic message: in today&#39;s world it is neither wealth nor power, nor the control of territory and technology that make the crucial difference. How we think and act shapes our present and decides our future.</p><p>According to systems philosopher and Club of Budapest founder Ervin Laszlo, our world is both unstable and unsustainable. Population pressure is increasing &#x2013; there are over 77 million humans added to the world each year, 97% of that number in poor countries. More than one-third of the world&#x2019;s natural resources have been destroyed by human activity and, if this trend were to continue, we would need not one, but two other planets the size of Earth by the year 2050. Poverty is spreading &#x2013; there are nearly 2 billion people living on less than 2 dollars a day, and the threat of terrorism is growing. Laszlo predicts that change must come: "Our world is divided and conflict-torn, and socially and ecologically unsustainable. We cannot remain as we are, nor can we go back to the conditions that are now behind us. We can only move forward, but not on the same path we have been following until now. We need to find a new direction for our individual and collective future. Half a century ago, Albert Einstein noted that we cannot solve a problem with the same kind of thinking that gave rise to it." <p>To inspire citizens to become agents of change, Laszlo created You Can Change the World: The Global Citizen&#x2019;s Handbook for Living on Planet Earth. Based on a report by the Club of Budapest, You Can Change the World (SelectBooks, $19.95) answers two pertinent questions &#x2013; first, what is at the root of all the conflict and crisis in today&#x2019;s world? and second, what can actually be done to move toward a world where we can live in peace, without marginalizing and killing each other and destroying the environment? You Can Change the World includes an introduction by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, and contributions from Japanese spiritual master Masami Saionji and best-selling spiritual author Paulo Coelho, as well as a guide to further reading.</p>Read this handbook, and start thinking.

By taking each mile step by step, they were able to intimately explore the coastal regions of Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska, see the wilderness in its larger context, and provide a unique on-the-ground perspective.

This sumptuous book offers a fresh overview of his achievement, reinterpreted for a new generation. Published to coincide with an exhibition opening at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in October of 1998. 318 illustrations, 218 in color. 9 foldouts.</p><p>The almost mythic Jackson Pollock--a roughshod, ill-mannered, prodigiously ambitious, aggressive, alcoholic, tormented artist--is alive and unwell in this book. But Kirk Varnedoe and Pepe Karmel, the chief curator and adjunct assistant curator, respectively, of the Museum of Modern Art's Department of Painting and Sculpture, also go deeply into Pollock's art in eye-opening ways. This book is the catalog for the retrospective of Pollock's art-shattering oeuvre at the Museum of Modern Art in the fall of 1998 and includes many biographical pictures as well as color plates of Pollock's paintings, from the awkward but earnest early works to the late, great, famous canvasses. Varnedoe's essay, aptly titled "Comet: Jackson Pollock's Life and Work," deftly invites the reader into Pollock's world, starting with his country studio: "The structure, often called a barn, is in fact more like a glorified tool shed." Karmel's essay, "Pollock at Work: The Films and Photographs of Hans Namuth," is a truly groundbreaking exploration of Pollock's technique. Karmel has scrutinized every frame of every piece of film, still or moving, ever taken of Pollock painting. He arrives at absolutely original conclusions: Pollock's all-over swirls of dripped and flung paint often began as figurative works and clearly relate to such all-American stalwarts as Thomas Hart Benton. Karmel makes countless other sharp observations, noting the difference, for example, between fast-looking marks and the slow, deliberate movements with which they were made (and vice versa). His essay is a work of brilliant scholarship, written thrillingly, and it will forever change the way any serious viewer looks at Pollock's paintings. It makes this volume absolutely essential for understanding the work of this great, sad artist. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i><b>Elizabeth Frank</b> has written extensively on both art and literature, including a biography of Louise Bogan.

In addition to vivid behind-the-scenes accounts of such acknowledged Welles landmarks as his innovative Mercury Theatre productions, the infamous War of the Worlds broadcast and film masterpieces Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons , Brady, biographer of Streisand, Hugh Hefner et al., unsparingly chronicles Welles's professional descent in a commercially oriented Hollywood that consistently turned a blind eye to the iconoclastic artist in its midst. Ironically, like his most enduring character, Charles Foster Kane, whom he once described as "fighting a losing battle with the twentieth century," Welles, in Brady's candid depiction, ends up a somewhat embittered, bewildered victim of the same fate. Photos. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Welles personified the cliche "bigger than life." His overwhelming persona and unfulfilled promise have been much written about, but little has been revealed about the man. Welles said he did not want an accurate description of himself but a flattering one, and he was not above embroidering the truth. Despite exhaustive research, this long and densely detailed biography, with its lengthy re-created conversations and minutiae, does not really succeed in finding the man beneath the legend. It is, however, quite readable despite Brady's tendency to pun and deserves a place beside Barbara Leaming's authorized biography, Orson Welles (Viking, 1985). It is superior to Charles Higham's somewhat superficial Orson Welles (LJ 12/1/85).<br><i>- Roy Liebman, California State Univ.

She lives in New Hampshire near her daughter, Katrin.Kindergarten-Grade 3-In this retelling of a traditional tale, young Ma'antah displays such extraordinary cleverness that she earns the nickname, Sense Pass King. The jealous monarch makes repeated attempts to dispose of the child, but ultimately brings her to live in his palace. When he falsely takes credit for slaying a seven-headed sea lizard and saving his future bride, feats accomplished by the pint-sized servant, the villagers have had enough of his dishonesty and cowardice. They drive him out of the kingdom, crown Sense Pass King queen, and all live happily ever after. Children will delight in the youngster's ability to outsmart grown-ups and find her way out of seemingly impossible predicaments. Expansive spreads of lush acrylic artwork are filled with humorous and, at times, magical details. In the final scene, Queen Ma'antah rubs the head of a panther with a snake perched on its back, while a curious audience of lizards, monkeys, and people look on in wonder.

One Navajo family, on a New Mexico reservation, struggles to survive in a world no longer theirs in the years just before and after World War II.</p><p>Leslie Marmon Silko was born in 1948 to a family whose ancestry includes Mexican, Laguna Indian, and European forebears. She has said that her writing has at its core &#x201c;the attempt to identify what it is to be a half-breed or mixed-blood person.&#x201d; As she grew up on the Laguna Pueblo Reservation, she learned the stories and culture of the Laguna people from her great-grandmother and other female relatives. After receiving her B. A. in English at the University of New Mexico, she enrolled in the University of New Mexico law school but completed only three semesters before deciding that writing and storytelling, not law, were the means by which she could best promote justice. She married John Silko in 1970. Prior to the writing of <i>Ceremony</i>, she published a series of short stories, including &#x201c;The Man to Send Rain Clouds.&#x201d; She also authored a volume of poetry, <i>Laguna Woman: Poems</i>, for which she received the Pushcart Prize for Poetry. <p>In 1973, Silko moved to Ketchikan, Alaska, where she wrote <i>Ceremony</i>. Initially conceived as a comic story abut a mother&#x2019;s attempts to keep her son, a war veteran, away from alcohol, <i>Ceremony</i> gradually transformed into an intricate meditation on mental disturbance, despair, and the power of stories and traditional culture as the keys to self-awareness and, eventually, emotional healing. Having battled depression herself while composing her novel, Silko was later to call her book &#x201c;a ceremony for staying sane.&#x201d; Silko has followed the critical success of <i>Ceremony</i> with a series of other novels, including <i>Storyteller, Almanac for the Dead</i>, and <i>Gardens in the Dunes</i>. Nevertheless, it was the singular achievement of <i>Ceremony</i> that first secured her a place among the first rank of Native American novelists.

My elder son, Robert Chapman, was seven years old, and Cazimir was eighteen months. Ketchikan was John Silko&#x2019;s hometown, and he&#x2019;d taken a supervisory position in the legal services office in Ketchikan. I had a book contract with Viking Press because Richard Seaver, who was a Viking editor, saw my short stories in Ken Rosen&#x2019;s anthology, <i>The Man to Send Rain Clouds</i>. At the time I thought it was odd that my book contract specified either a collection of short stories or a novel. I didn&#x2019;t have a literary agent then to explain that publishers preferred novels. I had no intention of writing anything but short stories for Viking Press; I felt confident about the short story as a genre, but aside from being a voracious reader of novels from age ten, I neglected to take that course the English Department offered on The Novel. No way I was going to mess with success. Short stories, that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;d write. I used my writer&#x2019;s grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to pay for day care for Caz while Robert was in school.</p><p>Located on Revillagigedo Island, 750 miles north of Seattle, Ketchikan had a mild climate by Alaskan standards due in large part to a warm ocean current named the Japanese Current. The average year-round temperature was forty-eight degrees, and the average rainfall was 180 inches. In Chinle the annual rainfall was twelve inches in a good year. I was accustomed to the bright sunlight of the Southwest, where the weather permitted activity outdoors all year around. In southeastern Alaska the tall spruce trees, the heavy clouds, fogs and mist and the steep mountains enclosed the town. In the Southwest I was accustomed to gazing into distances of forty or fifty miles. I was accustomed to seeing the sky and the stars and moon.</p><p>The change in climate had a profound effect on me; I spent all of June, July, and August fighting off the terrible lethargy of a depression caused in large part by the absence of sunlight. I managed to write one short story during that time, about a woman who drowned herself; it wasn&#x2019;t a good short story but a message to myself. In September after the boys were in day care and school, I tried to write at home but I found it difficult to concentrate: the dirty dishes and dirty laundry seemed to cry out for attention.</p><p>About this time Richard Whittaker came to my aid. Dick and his family lived across the street from my Silko in-laws. He practiced Indian law mostly for the local tribes, and he was a strong supporter of the Alaska Legal Services program, which employed my husband. Dick was a reader of novels and especially admired Kurt Vonnegut&#x2019;s <i>God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater</i>. I talked about needing a place to write, and Dick Whittaker invited me to use the table and chair in his closet-sized law library. His law office was located on the second floor of the building that housed the offices of the legal services program. The building is still there overlooking Ketchikan Creek, next to the great Chief Johnson totem pole with Raven and Fog Woman at the corner of Mission Street and Stedman Street.</p><p>I worked on the library table with my Hermes portable typewriter and a fountain pen. Once I saw what I&#x2019;d typed, I immediately edited with a fountain pen. Every day I read the previous day&#x2019;s writing to get myself started again. Luckily I was in the early stages when I didn&#x2019;t have much manuscript or many notes, because of course I could not leave my work spread out over the law library table: Dick Whittaker and his staff did need to use the law books from time to time. I wrote the short story &#x201c;Lullaby&#x201d; in the law library. I&#x2019;d already started to write what would become <i>Ceremony</i>, but after I heard Nash and Ada Chakee were killed, I allowed myself to stray from the novel long enough to write the short story in their memory.</p><p>After about six months, the legal services offices were moved to larger offices downtown, and I followed. There was a tiny office space there, but without a door. Some of the early draft of <i>Ceremony</i> is written on the back side of discarded legal services letterhead. I managed there for a couple of months until Dick Whittaker told me he couldn&#x2019;t find a renter for the office space vacated by legal services. Rent free, he gave me the exclusive use of the space complete with heat and lights and, best of all, no telephone.</p><p>There was an outer room that had been for reception, and the inner office that had windows that looked out on Raven and Fog Woman above Ketchikan Creek. The inner office had a chair and a wide, long built-in plywood work area shaped like a wing. The first thing I did was buy a can of Chinese red enamel and paint the plywood desk top. I brought an old percolator down to make hot water for instant coffee. Some days when I got to my office I didn&#x2019;t feel like working on the novel so I wrote letters to the new friends I&#x2019;d met at a writers conference in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, in June of 1973. Other days I&#x2019;d scoot the Hermes and manuscript over and I&#x2019;d stretch out on top of the work area for a nap.</p><p>My rule for myself was this: I had to stay in that room whether I wrote or not, and, finally, after I&#x2019;d written letters to Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge or Lawson Inada, the poets who provided me with moral support, or taken a nap, I&#x2019;d walk over to the window to look up at the big black raven carved above me on the top of the pole. A long way down the pole came Raven&#x2019;s two raven helpers, Gitsanuk and Gitsaqeq, their raven beaks oddly hooked, melted from the fire&#x2019;s heat the time they carried Raven&#x2019;s gift of fire to human beings. Then came the figures of Raven and his wife, Fog Woman, who held two salmon by the tails. The beauty of the carved figures lifted my spirits and I&#x2019;d finally break down my resistance, and start work on the novel.</p><p>At the time I didn&#x2019;t know much about the Chief Johnson pole or the story of Raven and Fog Woman, but later I learned what an auspicious location my writing office had. The Chief Johnson pole was set in 1901 to celebrate the potlatch given by Chief Johnson for the Kadjuk Tlingits. The carved figures recalled Raven&#x2019;s beloved wife, Fog Woman, who used Raven&#x2019;s spruce root hat to create the first salmon. Soon the rivers and ocean were jammed with salmon, and suddenly Raven was rich. Once he was rich, he began to neglect Fog Woman, and one day he spoke abusively to her until she ran toward the beach where she turned into fog. Raven told himself it didn&#x2019;t matter, but when he got home he found all the dried salmon he&#x2019;d stored came to life again and swam out to sea and Raven was as poor as before. The figure of Fog Woman on the pole faces the ocean at the place the salmon enter the creek to spawn; Fog Woman&#x2019;s gift of the salmon made the people of Ketchikan rich.</p><p>Lunchtime was easy. Mrs. Hirabayashi&#x2019;s caf� was only a half block away, on the street across from the docks and the fishing fleet. Mrs. Hirabayashi and her mother ran the place. It had a long white marble counter with stools where the fishermen liked to sit. They grew aged poinsettias plants in the caf� front window. It might have been a soda fountain at one time. The Hirabayashis, like other Japanese Americans, were imprisoned in internment camps during the war, and it was Gordon Hirabayashi, Mrs. Hirabayashi&#x2019;s son, who with others worked tirelessly to secure redress for the crime from the U.S. Congress.</p><p>Mrs. Hirabayashi welcomed all her customers with a joyous greeting, and her elderly mother working behind the stove smiled shyly and nodded. I always ordered the same thing: green tea and a bowl of pork noodles. Except for me and a few old Tlingit and Haida people, the Hirabayshis&#x2019; customers were fishermen in rubber boots and gray wool halibut jackets. Usually it was raining. My first October, in 1973, Ketchikan got 42.5 inches of rain in thirty-one days. So after my noodles and tea, I usually went straight back to my writing and worked until three, when it was time to fetch Caz from day care to be home when Robert returned from school.</p><p>If it wasn&#x2019;t raining too hard, sometimes I wandered around downtown Ketchikan just looking at the fishing boats or giant cruise ships and the vast flotillas of spruce logs towed by tug-boats to the pulp mill. Big ravens cavorted on the docks in search of tidbits from the fishing boats, but most amazing to my eyes were the great bald eagles, a dozen or more, that lounged or played in the tops of tall spruce while they waited to dive into the water for salmon. After a while I realized that Raven and Eagle still owned the town; the old-time tribal people belonged to the clans of Killer Whale, Grizzly Bear, and Wolf. Humans belonged to Halibut and King Salmon and Steel Head Trout clans too; surrounded by ocean, rivers, creeks, and rainwater, the watery clans seemed a safer bet. The totern poles often had small wan faces of &#x201c;drowned men&#x201d; carved between the major figures&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t swim and boats made me seasick&#x2014;the small wan face might be me.</p><p>Once I started writing the novel, the depression lifted, but then came the terrible migraine headaches, worse than any I&#x2019;d had since the tenth grade. I stayed in a darkened bedroom for eight hours at a time while the vertigo spun the bed. Fortunately, as the main character, Tayo, began to recover from his illness, I too began to feel better, and had fewer headaches. By this time, the novel was my refuge, my magic vehicle back to the Southwest land of sandstone mesas, blue sky, and sun. As I described the sandstone spring, the spiders, water bugs, swallows, and rattlesnakes, I remade the place in words; I was no longer on a dark rainy island thousands of miles away. I was home, from time immemorial, as the old ones liked to say to us children long ago.</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t just homesick for the sandstone cliffs and the sun; I missed the people and the storytelling, so I incorporated into the novel the old-time story about Hummingbird and Green Fly, who help the people purify their town to bring back the Corn Mother. The title of the novel, <i>Ceremony</i>, refers to the healing ceremonies based on the ancient stories of the Din� and Pueblo people. The two years I lived and taught for Din� College were important to my understanding of the healing ceremony&#x2019;s relationship to storytelling. I was conscious of constructing the novel out of many different kinds of narratives or stories to celebrate storytelling with the spoken as well as the written word. I indulged myself with the old-time stories because they evoked a feeling of comfort I remembered from my childhood at Laguna.</p><p>During this time the wet climate did not agree with my younger son, Cazimir, who was twice hospitalized for acute asthma. Grandma Lillie, on a visit to Ketchikan, suffered a heart attack. At crisis times I completely forgot the novel, but afterward the need to return to the work became overwhelming. The novel was my escape, and I remember how I fretted on weekends because I was so anxious to keep working. I wasn&#x2019;t sure what I was writing qualified as a &#x201c;novel.&#x201d;</p><p>It was supposed to be a funny story about Harley, the Wor...</p></p><h2>Papa&#39;s Wife</h2><p>Pastor Franyon&#39;s sixteen-year-old maid determines to marry him despite the handsome preacher&#39;s resolve to remain a bachelor</p><p></p><h2>Miss Suzy</h2><p>Miss Suzy is a little gray squirrel who lives happily in her oak-tree home until she is chased away by some mean red squirrels.

Cole also looks at how mathematical principles apply in unexpected fields. One chapter, for example, vindicates the theories on voting rights that cost Lani Guinier her Justice Department nomination in 1993.</p><p> Without relying on a single equation, Cole's gently humorous prose helps make mathematics unthreatening to laypeople, enabling them to better understand the world in which they live.</p>A popular science columnist for the Los Angeles Times and teacher at UCLA, K.C.

Among the U.S. venues where he has had solo shows are the Guggenheim Museum, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston. <br> <br> <b>Gerhard Richter</b> was born in 1932 in Dresden, Germany. Since the early 1960s he has emerged as one of the essential painters of the postwar period, pioneering photorealism with paintings made from found photographs (amateur snapshots, advertisements and book and magazine illustrations) and then from his own photographs. His work has also profoundly engaged with and influenced such genres as Pop and abstract art. A retrospective of Richter's work was shown in 2001 at The Museum of Modern Art, New York. The exhibition was one of the largest ever organized there for a living artist, and traveled to The Art Institute of Chicago, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C. <br> <br> <b>Lawrence Weiner</b> was born in 1942 in the Bronx, New York. Upon graduating from high school, he worked in a variety of jobs--on an oil tanker, on docks, and unloading railroad cars--and then traveled throughout North America before returning to New York, where he exhibited at the Seth Siegelaub Gallery in 1964 and 1965. Since the 1970s, wall installations consisting solely of words in a nondescript lettering have been a primary medium for Weiner. Solo exhibitions of his work have been mounted at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., ICA London, Dia Center for the Arts in New York, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, among others.

An enthusiastic young chef shares his teen-tested tips and recipes for everything from breakfast to dinner, desserts to brain-boosting snacks.</b><br><br>A kid's gotta eat &#x2014; and what better way to make sure that the food on your plate hits the spot than to make it yourself? Fourteen-year-old Sam Stern, with a bit of help from his mom, Susan, is more than happy to share dozens of his favorite recipes for all occasions. There are pancakes for breakfast and easy lunches like soup or salad to pack up for school. Quick meals like spaghetti or omelettes are best for busy school nights; for weekends there are serious dinners like homemade lasagna or whole roasted chicken. And don't forget fancy, mouth-watering desserts; addictive but healthy snacks; and even special menus and suggestions to help keep your brain awake during dreaded exam time. Especially geared toward teen readers is the lively running commentary from Sam, plus colorful photos of food preparation and the ultimate chef's reward: feasting with friends.</p><p>SAM STERN is a fourteen-year-old student who excels in drama and creative writing. Like many of his friends &#x2014; and his mother and mentor, Susan Stern &#x2014; he loves to cook and eat. Sam enjoys sports, fishing, climbing with his older brother, and going out to hear all kinds of music, including indie rock and jazz. He is rarely seen without an iPod.Gr. 6-9. In a year when two young chefs, ages 8 and 10, were nominated for the James Beard Award, it's clear that kids are increasingly comfortable in the kitchen. English teen Sam Stern, with his mother's help, offers this slender, photo-packed cookbook, unusual not only because of its author but also because it focuses on guys, with chapters such as "Impress the Girls." That said, the recipes, presented in a casual but clear voice, will draw both genders. An opening section presents some insight into cooking's appeal for teens: "It's brilliant to know that you can be independent," Sam says of the ability to cook what he wants, when he wants it. Suggestions for breakfast, dinner, and snacks are included, as are dishes for parties and for boosting brainpower during exams. Although the recipes aren't technically difficult, kids without any kitchen experience will need lots of help. Still, the bright, energetic text and color photos of Sam and his photogenic friends and family will easily pull in aspiring foodies. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

His best-known drawings exemplify the intimate and light-hearted style of rococo, which dominated much of the 18th century. He produced some 10,000 drawings during his career, often employing his wife and children as sitters. This outstanding book assembles new research on Boucher&#39;s drawings, examining his role in shaping the growing market for drawings in 18th-century France. It explores his development as a draftsman, his range of subjects and his innovations in the context of the greatest French draftsmen of his time.</p><p></p><h2>Buddhist Mahayana Texts (Sacred Books of the East)</h2><p><p>Originally published in the Sacred Books of the East Series, under the general editorship of F.

Of Indian origin, around the beginning of the Christian era, it is concerned with the life and teachings of the Buddha &#x2014; now quite far removed from the Pali documents of the Hinayana. The original text, which was fragmentary, has been completed by the addition of four books by a nineteenth-century Nepalese scholar, Amritananda.<br>Max M�ller has translated the Larger and Smaller Sukhavati-vyuha, in which the Buddha describes the Land of Bliss to an assembly of the sangha, gods, spirits, and others. This is followed by Dr. M�ller's translation of the Vagrakkhedika (The Diamond Cutter), a metaphysical treatise, and the Larger and Smaller Pragna &#x2014; paramitahridaya-sutras, two brief kernel statements of the Mahayana. The final document for Japanese Buddhism, the highly important Amitayur-dhyana-sutra, has been translated by Dr. J. Takakusu. Called the Meditation Sutra, it describes meditation and concentration techniques in terms of Amida Buddhism.

Five months ago you took off for outer space with Broxholm. Five minutes ago you showed up in a beam of blue light and told Duncan and me we had to help you save the world. I want to know what happened in between.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me, too!&#x201d; said Duncan.<br> <br>Five months ago I wouldn&#x2019;t have cared what Duncan Dougal thought. As far as I was concerned, he was the world&#x2019;s biggest snotball, a kid whose main hobbies were drooling on his homework, farting in class, and beating me up. I thought he was as likable as a mosquito, as friendly as a rattlesnake, and as useful as a screen door in a spaceship.<br> <br>But that was before I got a good look at the inside of his head&#x2014;which was less frightening and more sad than I ever would have guessed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, since you asked&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; I drawled.<br> <br>&#x201c;Peter,&#x201d; snapped Susan, &#x201c;for five months every kid in Kennituck Falls has been dying to know what happened to you after you went off with Broxholm. Stop stalling and tell the story, or you&#x2019;re going to be very sorry!&#x201d;<br> <br>So I told them. But that wasn&#x2019;t good enough. Oh, no. Now they insist I have to write it down. &#x201c;We wrote about our part,&#x201d; they keep saying. &#x201c;Now it&#x2019;s your turn.&#x201d;<br> <br>So here goes:<br> <br>As you probably know, it all started when this alien named Broxholm wanted to kidnap five kids from our sixth grade class last spring. He started by trapping our real teacher, Ms. Schwartz, in a force field. He kept her in his attic while he disguised himself as a substitute teacher named Mr. Smith and took over our class.<br> <br>One day Susan followed Mr. Smith home and saw him peel off his face. Underneath his human mask was a green-skinned, orange-eyed alien.<br> <br>Susan came to me for help, mostly because she didn&#x2019;t think anyone else would believe her. She thought I might because I used to read so much science fiction.<br> <br>The two of us spent days trying to figure out how to stop Broxholm. One night I was sitting home alone, eating a can of cold beans and wondering where my father was, when it hit me that if we couldn&#x2019;t stop Broxholm, if some kids had to go into space, I might as well be one of them. It wouldn&#x2019;t be any worse than staying where I was. And it might be better.<br> <br>I was frightened by the idea, of course. But I didn&#x2019;t think the aliens were going to dissect my brain or anything like that. In fact, I figured I might learn as much from them as they did from me.<br> <br>That was the key, I guess; I knew I could learn something. That was important to me, since learning is the one thing I really like. If that sounds strange, look at it like this: if other kids treated you like a nerd and a geek all the time, if you went for weeks feeling like books were your only friends&#x2014;well, you might really be into learning, too.<br> <br>Anyway, between being the school dumping ground for emotional toxic waste and having a father who didn&#x2019;t give two bags of llama droppings whether I was alive or dead, I figured I didn&#x2019;t have much to lose by going with Broxholm.<br> <br>Besides, more than anything else in the world, I wanted to travel to the stars and explore other planets.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s why when Susan and the school band overpowered the alien on the night of our spring concert, I slipped around back to help him escape.<br> <br>After I let Broxholm out, he turned and used something that looked like a pencil to melt the door shut.<br> <br>Oh, oh, I thought. Now you&#x2019;re in for it, Peter.<br> <br>But then I thought, Well, wait a minute. If he has a weapon like that, he could have fried the whole crowd.<br> <br>Since he hadn&#x2019;t, I figured he wasn&#x2019;t going to make me into sausage; at least, not right away.<br> <br>So when he started to run, I began to run alongside him.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; cried the alien.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to come with you!&#x201d;<br> <br>I think Broxholm would have stopped running right then, if he had figured it was safe. It wasn&#x2019;t, so he kept going. He was in good shape; I didn&#x2019;t hear him pant or gasp for breath at all. (Of course, for all I knew, when people from his planet got tired it made their armpits ache.)<br> <br>Three blocks from the school he stopped running.<br> <br>Then he disappeared.<br> <br>I felt like my heart had disappeared, too. Never mind that Broxholm was a lean, green kidnapper from outer space. He was going back to the stars, and I wanted to go with him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Broxholm!&#x201d; I yelled. &#x201c;Wait! Take me!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Be quiet while I adjust this!&#x201d; snapped a voice beside me.<br> <br>An instant later I disappeared, too. Which is to say, I became invisible because of something Broxholm did.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; I whispered, looking down at where I used to be, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s awesome!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shut up, or you stay here,&#x201d; growled Broxholm.<br> <br>I shut up. I may have saved his bacon back at the school, and I may have been the only one willing to go with him, but I figured if I got in the way of his escape, Broxholm would dump me faster than my mother had dumped my father when something better came along.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now, follow me,&#x201d; whispered Broxholm.<br> <br>&#x201c;How? I can&#x2019;t see you!&#x201d;<br> <br>After a moment of silence, I felt strong hands grab me by the waist. &#x201c;Stay quiet!&#x201d; hissed Broxholm as he tossed me over his shoulder. It reminded me of the first day I had met him, when he picked up Duncan and me to stop us from fighting.<br> <br>He started to run. He was amazingly fast.<br> <br>When we reached the little house where Broxholm had been living, he made us both visible again. Turning to me, he said, &#x201c;I have some things to do before we can go. I also owe you a favor. Here it is: you have three minutes to change your mind. Otherwise, you&#x2019;re coming with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Before I could say a thing, he walked away&#x2014;leaving me alone to make the biggest decision of my life.<br> <br>Back at school that decision had been easy. Lying in my bed, in my empty house, I had known for sure what I would do. But this wasn&#x2019;t just some wishing game anymore. It was real.<br> <br>I thought about my father. Would he miss me? Probably. At least, for a little while. Then he&#x2019;d probably be just as glad I was gone; one less nuisance for him to cope with.<br> <br>I thought about school, where I spent most of my time trying not to get beat up by Duncan and other jerks who thought being smart was a crime.<br> <br>My life would have been a lot different if it was okay to be smart in school. But it&#x2019;s not. It&#x2019;s okay to be pretty smart. But not real smart&#x2014;which is kind of stupid when you think about it. I mean, all these guys picking on smart kids and calling them geeks and dweebs are going to grow up and want to know why they don&#x2019;t do something about the terrible state the world is in.<br> <br>I can tell you why. By the time they grow up, most of the kids who really could have changed things are wrecked.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ll bet you this very minute, even while you&#x2019;re reading these words, some kid who&#x2019;s bright enough to cure cancer when he or she grows up is getting hassled for being an &#x201c;egghead.&#x201d;<br> <br>Any takers?<br> <br>Anyway, I had plenty of reasons to run away. But that wasn&#x2019;t what made up my mind. I didn&#x2019;t just want to run away; I wanted to run to something. And that something was space.<br> <br>I thought about my father again, and wondered if he had ever loved me.<br> <br>I thought about the stars, and the secrets they held.<br> <br>Broxholm walked into the kitchen, carrying a large wooden box and two flat pieces of plastic. I recognized the pieces of plastic: they were part of his communication system. Later I found out that the box was his dressing table, all folded up.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>My hands were trembling like a pair of gerbils that had just been dropped into a snake pit. Some of that was terror; some of it was pure excitement. Looking straight into his huge orange eyes, I whispered, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming with you.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Golden Age of Couture: Paris and London 1947 - 1957</h2><p>In 1947, Christian Dior&#x2019;s &#x201c;New Look&#x201d; was greeted with both shock and delight, making headlines around the world.

Serio </b>has been the editor of <i>The Wallace Stevens Journal</i> for more than twenty-five years. He is a professor at Clarkson University in upstate New York.<b>Introduction</b><br>&nbsp;<br>What can one say about a poet who writes, quite tenderly, &#x201c;And for what, except for you, do I feel love?&#x201d; and who does not mean his wife, or his daughter, or any other person, but rather an imaginary figure: the muse? But that is how Wallace Stevens begins the prologue to what many consider his greatest poem, &#x201c;Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction&#x201d;&#x2014;with a passionate, intimate address not to a beloved but to an intangible concept: inspiration. With something approaching erotic fervor, Stevens personifies an abstraction and speaks directly to poetry, as if it were his lover:<br>&nbsp;<br>In the uncertain light of single, certain truth,<br>Equal in living changingness to the light<br>In which I meet you, in which we sit at rest,<br>For a moment in the central of our being,<br>The vivid transparence that you bring is peace.<br>&nbsp;<br>No other poet I know of has written so elegantly and so persuasively about the beauty and significance of poetry in everyday life. We find these declarations not only in Stevens&#x2019;s poems but also in his essays, most of which originated as invited lectures on the subject of poetry. In these essays, Stevens seduces us with his enchanting prose to believe in the spiritual importance of poetry. The imagination&#x2014;frequently synonymous with the act of the mind, or poetry, for Stevens&#x2014;is what gives life its savor, its sanction, its sacred quality. In a passage from &#x201c;The Noble Rider and the Sound of Words,&#x201d; he stresses the importance of poetic language by evoking our human craving for the sound of words:<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The deepening need for words to express our thoughts and feelings which, we are sure, are all the truth that we shall ever experience, having no illusions, makes us listen to words when we hear them, loving them and feeling them, makes us search the sound of them, for a finality, a perfection, an unalterable vibration, which it is only within the power of the acutest poet to give them.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Noting that the imagination (poetry) must be based on reality, and furthermore that the interdependence of the imagination and reality is crucial, Stevens goes on to isolate poetry&#x2019;s inherent distinctiveness: It bestows nobility, a quality he defines as &#x201c;our spiritual height and depth.&#x201d; Nobility emerges from the press of the imagination against a world that seems chaotic, crass, violent, and banal. The task of the poet is to transmit his imaginative power to others. Stevens sees the poet fulfilling himself &#x201c;only as he sees his imagination become the light in the minds of others.&#x201d; Simply put, the poet&#x2019;s role &#x201c;is to help people to live their lives.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>One could cite other essays that make Stevens&#x2019;s case for poetry, but the real question is: How well does his own poetry measure up to his ideal? After all, the telling phrase in the opening line of the invocation to &#x201c;Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction&#x201d; is &#x201c;except for you.&#x201d; Since the &#x201c;you&#x201d; refers to the creative faculty of the mind, it excludes everything else, including, of course, people. At the very least, such devotion to art rather than another person might strike a reader as odd. It has certainly struck many readers as cold and impersonal. With such observations as the following, Stevens has done little to alter that impression: &#x201c;Life is not people and scene but thought and feeling;&#x201d; &#x201c;Life is an affair of people not of places. But for me life is an affair of places and that is the trouble;&#x201d; &#x201c;I have no life except in poetry.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>There is an abstract feature to much of Stevens&#x2019;s poetry that distinguishes it from that of most other poets. Modern lyric poets, for example, usually write about more tangible topics, often using the first-person singular. One thinks of the speaker contrasting his neighbor&#x2019;s view of walls with his own in Robert Frost&#x2019;s &#x201c;Mending Wall,&#x201d; or the persona&#x2019;s sudden reversal of perspective toward a rather ugly, lice-infested fish in Elizabeth Bishop&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Fish,&#x201d; or even the paralyzing insecurity of T. S. Eliot&#x2019;s J. Alfred Prufrock, dreading a social encounter (&#x201c;In the room the women come and go / Talking of Michelangelo&#x201d;). Each of these poems has a well-defined speaker and a clear setting. Each invites the reader to identify with or relate to the principal human figure in the poem.<br>&nbsp;<br>By contrast, Stevens&#x2019;s poems frequently seem bizarre, theoretical, and detached. What is one to make of lines such as &#x201c;The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream&#x201d;; or &#x201c;A. A violent order is disorder; and / B. A great disorder is an order&#x201d;; or &#x201c;There it was, word for word, / The poem that took the place of a mountain&#x201d;? In addition, Stevens often employs strange characters, such as the mountain-minded Hoon, Professor Eucalyptus, and Canon Aspirin. He seldom uses the first-person form in his poetry, and when he does, it is likely to be in the plural form of &#x201c;we.&#x201d; Although he occasionally chooses the second-person &#x201c;you,&#x201d; he usually resorts to an anonymous third-person &#x201c;he&#x201d; or &#x201c;she,&#x201d; or to the even more remote &#x201c;one.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>How then do we explain Stevens&#x2019;s subject and elucidate his greatness as a poet? The answer is simple: His major achievement is the expression of the self in all its amplitude and, in fact, teasingly beyond it. In this respect, he writes in the grand tradition of romantic poetry.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ironically, his strategies of distancing&#x2014;his use of odd characters, his opening philosophical gambits, his impersonal voice&#x2014;serve to objectify and make authentic deeply personal sources of feeling and thought. To borrow Eliot&#x2019;s phrase, Stevens&#x2019;s poems become objective correlatives of various states within the reader, not only of heart and mind but also of being.<br>&nbsp;<br>By analogy, consider what happens when one reads a poem such as Walt Whitman&#x2019;s &#x201c;Song of Myself.&#x201d; Given the title, one naturally assumes that this is Whitman&#x2019;s personal declaration, his own song. After all, he begins rather explicitly: &#x201c;I celebrate myself, and sing myself.&#x201d; But as one continues to read&#x2014;as one absorbs the language, the sounds, the images, the rhythms&#x2014;a revelation emerges: This is not Whitman&#x2019;s song of self at all, but rather &#x201c;mine.&#x201d; Whitman&#x2019;s song of self has subtly transformed itself into the reader&#x2019;s. One realizes, sometimes with a jolt, that the title, &#x201c;Song of Myself,&#x201d; is a play on words: it has a double and much more personal meaning. <br>&nbsp;<br>Similarly, when Stevens writes, &#x201c;And for what, except for you, do I feel love?&#x201d; we, as readers, respond to the language, to our &#x201c;need for words to express our thoughts and feelings.&#x201d; We search their sound &#x201c;for a finality, a perfection, an unalterable vibration&#x201d; that expresses not Stevens&#x2019;s self but ours.

His first story was published in 1963, and his first novel, <i>Chthon, </i>in 1967. His first Xanth novel, <i>A Spell for Chameleon, </i>won the August Derleth Fantasy Award as the best novel for 1977, and his fantasy novels began placing on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list with <i>Ogre, Ogre</i>.

Remember Jack (as in "Jack be nimble")? Seems he wasn't exactly a blazing success in the end. In fact, "Jack tripped over the candlestick,/ Caught fire in a flash./ Now all that's left of Jack/ Is a little bit of ash." And Humpty Dumpty, on his way to becoming an omelette for all the king's horses and men, ends up as a royal mess when the monarch puts him in the blender without the lid. Other nursery celebrities include the old woman in the shoe, Miss Muffet and Jack Sprat and his wife; Greenberg also lampoons lesser-known characters such as Little King Boggen, Baby Dolly and Jerry Hall (no, not the one married to Mick Jagger), who is swallowed by a rat ("Now there isn't any question/ He will suffer in digestion"). As he gleefully mixes metaphors and scrambles genres, Greenberg risks annoying readers with forced rhymes or choppy rhythms that are a bit of a chore to read, but the overall fun factor compensates. Schindler's waggish illustrations join in the merry parody, at one point even conjuring a farmer's wife who resembles Martha Stewart to demonstrate the utility of the tails off the three blind mice ("They're good for noodles, pickup sticks,/ Good to tickle your toes,/ Good for yarn, candlewicks/ Good to pick your nose"). The oblong format adds to the volume's visual appeal. All ages. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.Some silly variations on the fates of familiar nursery rhyme characters add cheap laughs to traditional Mother Goose tales. Greenberg proposes that after Humpty's great fall, he almost became a giant omelet, but was accidentally splattered on the kitchen wall instead. Mother Goose and her gander ``both went/up to heaven/After colliding with a/747!'' Peter Pumpkin Eater's wife gets her revenge by sticking her husband in a loaf of bread. Sending up Mother Goose can be rewarding, but it's never easy; the author, with little of the grace or beat of the originals, twists many tales with trendy, explicitly gross humor, e.g., Jack Spratt and his wife lick not only the platter clean, but a city bus, the dog's nose, and a garbage truck. The illustrations, despite their giddiness, have a decidedly old-fashioned feel, demonstrating Schindler's facility with nursery rhyme characterizations in finely inked cross-hatchings.

His legendary Whole Earth Catalogue won the US National Book Award in 1972. Brand, whose previous books include The Media Lab, How Buildings Learn, and The Clock of the Long Now, is president and cofounder of the Long Now Foundation and co-founder of the Global Business Network. He lives with his wife, Ryan Phelan, on a tugboat in San Francisco Bay.Brand, co-author of the seminal 1969 <i>Whole Earth Catalog</i>, compiles reflections and lessons learned from more than 40 years as an environmentalist in this clumsy yet compelling attempt to inspire practicable solutions to climate change. Brand haphazardly organizes his manifesto into chapters that address environmental stewardship opportunities, exhorting environmentalists to become fearless about following science; his iconoclastic proposals include transitioning to nuclear energy and ecosystem engineering. Brand believes environmentalists must embrace nuclear energy expansion and other inevitable technological advances, and refreshingly suggests a shift in the environmentalists' dogmatic approach to combating climate change. Rejecting the inflexible message so common in the Green movement, he describes a process of reasonable debate and experimentation. Brand's fresh perspective, approachable writing style and manifest wisdom ultimately convince the reader that the future is not an abyss to be feared but an opportunity for innovative problem solvers to embrace enthusiastically. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"Perhaps the greatest of these and the one most lacking in the average garden today is a sense of unity. It is a quality found in all the great landscapes, based on the rhythm of natural land-form, the domination of one type of vegetation, and the fact that human use and buildings have kept in sympathy with their surroundings. When we say that landscape has been spoilt we mean that it has lost this unity". Of particular interest to readers also are the lengthy chapter on plants and their uses, and the author's studies of the extension of the private garden to the shared, and on to public open space.</p><p></p><h2>America, Compromised (Berlin Family Lectures)</h2><p>&#x201c;There is not a single American awake to the world who is comfortable with the way things are.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> So begins Lawrence Lessig's sweeping indictment of contemporary American institutions and the corruption that besets them. We can all see it&#x2014;from the selling of Congress to special interests to the corporate capture of the academy. Something is wrong. It&#x2019;s getting worse.<br> &nbsp;<br> And it&#x2019;s our fault. What Lessig shows, brilliantly and persuasively, is that we can&#x2019;t blame the problems of contemporary American life on bad people, as our discourse all too often tends to do. Rather, he explains, &#x201c;We have allowed core institutions of America&#x2019;s economic, social, and political life to become corrupted. Not by evil souls, but by good souls. Not through crime, but through compromise.&#x201d; Every one of us, every day, making the modest compromises that seem necessary to keep moving along, is contributing to the rot at the core of American civic life. Through case studies of Congress, finance, the academy, the media, and the law, Lessig shows how institutions are drawn away from higher purposes and toward money, power, quick rewards&#x2014;the first steps to corruption.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lessig knows that a charge so broad should not be levied lightly, and that our instinct will be to resist it. So he brings copious, damning detail gleaned from years of research, building a case that is all but incontrovertible: America is on the wrong path. If we don&#x2019;t acknowledge our own part in that, and act now to change it, we will hand our children a less perfect union than we were given. It will be a long struggle. This book represents the first steps.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Lawrence Lessig </b>is the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law and Leadership at Harvard Law School, an attorney, and an activist. He cofounded Creative Commons in 2001 and is the author of numerous books, including, most recently, <i>Republic, Lost: Version 2.0</i>."<i>America, Compromised</i> is about the country in the Trump era, but not about Trump. Indeed, Lessig would have written much the same book if Hillary Clinton were president and if Democrats had control of both houses of Congress. His focus is not on bad people doing bad things, but on how incentives across a range of institutions have created corruption, with deleterious consequences for the nation. . . . <i>America, Compromised</i> join[s] an impressive array of books and essays that may, someday, have a future intellectual historian using them as examples to lament the fact that his or her contemporaries are not as eloquent or important as the group that arose in the Trump era to combat the threats to our way of life."<br> &nbsp; (Norm Ornstein <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>"Lessig lays out a working definition and theory of corruption that is at once simple and comprehensive, a devastating argument that America is racing for the cliff's edge of structural, possibly irreversible tyranny."<br> &nbsp; (Cory Doctorow)</p><h2>Keeping You a Secret</h2><p>As she begins a very tough last semester of high school, Holland finds herself puzzled about her future and intrigued by a transfer student who wants to start a Lesbigay club at school.</p><p>Julie Anne Peters is the author of How Do You Spell G-E-E-K?, Romance of the Snob Squad, Revenge of the Snob Squad and Define "Normal."<br>Reviewed with Tea Benduhn's <i>Gravel Queen</i>.<p>Gr. 9-12. In these novels about first love, a high-school girl falls hard for another girl and faces the complicated pain of coming out to family, friends, and to one's self. In <i>Gravel Queen,</i> the author's debut novel, Aurin explores her first gay relationship, and finds that her best friend, a glamorous, possessive drama queen, is jealous. Benduhn focus on Aurin's self-discovery and friendships, closing the novel before Aurin tells her family what's going on. In<i> Keeping You a Secret,</i> model high-school senior Holland, who has a boyfriend, develops an overwhelming crush on Cece. The girls fall passionately in love and a tragic coming-out story ensues. Holland finds herself homeless and alone, except for Cece and a new gay support system.</p><p>Both novels, written in first-person, are filled with believable inner monologues and finely tuned contemporary dialogue. Benduhn includes some interesting cinematic references related to Aurin's filmmaking aspirations, but some of her descriptions are over-the-top. Peters' story and characters are more developed. Both books are romantic and layered, and many teens, particularly those with fluid sexual identities, will recognize the questions: Do you have to kiss someone to be gay?

They both stood, while Dino held her chair, a sure sign of fear.<br>&#x201c;How are you, Genevieve?&#x201d; Stone said, giving her a kiss.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m very well, Stone,&#x201d; she said, ignoring Dino. &#x201c;How was your Malibu training?&#x201d;<br>Stone shot a glance at Dino, who was looking very uncomfortable. &#x201c;Hard work and great fun. The new airplane is faster, smoother, and quieter, only it&#x2019;s not a Malibu anymore; it&#x2019;s called a JetProp.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I remember,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going nuts,&#x201d; Dino said.<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Lance just came in again, and he looks perfectly fine.&#x201d;<br>Stone turned and looked, and there he was, younger, undisheveled, unbruised, and perfectly groomed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re both going nuts,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>Lance came over to the table and greeted them all, shaking their hands. &#x201c;Good evening,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Lance,&#x201d; Dino said, &#x201c;you should be working as a magician.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I beg your pardon?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because, in addition to standing here, you&#x2019;re sitting back there.&#x201d; Dino pointed.<br>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s my older brother, Barton Cabot.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ahhhhh,&#x201d; Dino and Stone said, simultaneously.<br>&#x201c;He came in ahead of me while I finished a phone call in the car. If you&#x2019;ll excuse me, I&#x2019;m going to join him, but Stone, I&#x2019;d like to speak with you alone, after we&#x2019;ve ordered dinner.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Stone said. In his experience, when Lance spoke to him alone, trouble invariably followed.<br>Lance went to join his brother.<br>&#x201c;Eerie resemblance,&#x201d; Genevieve said.<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Dino agreed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like Lance can know exactly how he&#x2019;ll look in a few years.&#x201d;<br>Genevieve spoke to Dino for the first time. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s how you&#x2019;re going to look when I&#x2019;m finished with you,&#x201d; she said.<br>Stone made a point of inspecting a row of photographs of Elaine&#x2019;s regulars on the opposite wall.<br>Elaine came over and sat down, exchanging kisses with Genevieve. Dino looked relieved to have her there. &#x201c;So?&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;I just got in,&#x201d; Stone replied.<br>&#x201c;From where?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;From Vero Beach, Florida.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What for?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dino will explain it to you,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>Lance came and tapped Stone on the shoulder. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go into the next room for a minute,&#x201d; he said.<br>Dino looked anxious. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be all right,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Elaine is here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll help Genevieve,&#x201d; Dino said.<br>Stone got up and followed Lance into the dining room next door, where people occasionally threw parties and which Elaine used for overflow when the main room was full. They sat down at a table.<br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know you had a brother,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t had a brother for many years. Until tonight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Does he live in New York?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Lance said.<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I have no idea where he lives. Neither does he. That&#x2019;s the difficult thing.&#x201d;<br>Stone settled in for a story.</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>Stone thought Lance looked as though he needed a drink.<br>&#x201c;Can I get you a drink, Lance?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thank you, no. We&#x2019;ve got a flap on&#x2014;two agents missing in Afghanistan&#x2014;and I have a meeting with the director in two hours.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In the middle of the night?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I have to make a recommendation,&#x201d; Lance said. &#x201c;We think we know where they are: Do we send in more people to get them and risk the lives of a hundred men, or do we call in an air strike and kill everybody.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Including the two agents?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the decision. There&#x2019;s a chopper waiting for me at the West Side helipad. That&#x2019;s why I can&#x2019;t deal with this right now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Deal with what?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My brother, Barton.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Start at the beginning, Lance.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My brother is four years older than I. Barton has been a star all his life: In school, in sports, wherever he went, he was always the star. Our mother died in childbirth with me. When I was twelve, our father died, and Barton became a surrogate father. He joined the Marines during the war in Vietnam, right out of Harvard; got a commission, led a platoon. I was at Harvard then. By the time it was over he was a colonel, commanding a regiment. Nobody in the Marines had advanced so quickly since World War Two. He was sent to the War College and told he would be a general before long, perhaps a future chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sounds like a spectacular career.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It was, until he abruptly resigned his commission and disappeared.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Disappeared?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nobody could find him. I tried and failed. When I was giving my commencement speech at my graduation I looked down and saw him in the audience, but when the thing was over, he had disappeared again. I didn&#x2019;t see him again until tonight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So he abandoned you when you were in college?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not entirely. My fees were paid, and a generous check arrived every month from a trust he had set up to receive my inheritance, since I was not yet of age. I wrote to him in care of the bank, but my letter was returned.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But you heard from him tonight?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not exactly. I had a call earlier this evening from a hospital in New York, saying that the police had found him, three days ago, unconscious, on the street. He had been beaten and, apparently, robbed, since he had no money or identification. His wristwatch had been taken, too. He was unconscious for around thirty hours, and when he woke, he didn&#x2019;t know who he was. The police tried to identify him, and today they finally got a match on his fingerprints and got hold of his service record, where I was listed as his next of kin. Somebody at the Pentagon recognized my name and called me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Has Barton recovered his memory?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Somewhat. He knows his name, he remembers me, but not much else. No one has been able to find an address for him, since his wallet was stolen. That&#x2019;s why I need your help.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What do you want me to do?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;His doctor told me that this sort of amnesia is usually temporary; the memory comes back in bits and pieces. It&#x2019;s a good sign that he has begun to remember. The hospital had to discharge him, since he has recovered from the beating and he has a next of kin. They released him to me tonight. But I can&#x2019;t take him back to Langley with me, not in the middle of this crisis.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do you want me to find him a hotel?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s a good idea just yet; he needs to regain his memory before he can be left alone.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I suppose I could put him up at my house for a couple of days,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;Thank you, Stone. I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;ll be any trouble; he&#x2019;s quite docile. I&#x2019;d also like you, perhaps with Dino&#x2019;s help, to find out where he lives and, when he recovers himself, take him to his home.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But you don&#x2019;t have any idea at all where he lives?&#x201d;<br>Lance shook his head. &#x201c;None.&#x201d; He looked at his watch. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a car waiting to take me to the helipad. Come and meet Barton.&#x201d; He got up and led Stone into the main dining room.<br>Barton Cabot was sitting at his table, talking in a companionable way with Elaine, who was sitting with him.<br>&#x201c;Stone,&#x201d; Lance said, &#x201c;this is my brother.&#x201d;<br>Barton rose and extended his hand. &#x201c;Barton Cabot,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Elaine and I were just catching up.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know Elaine?&#x201d; Lance asked.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s an old customer,&#x201d; Elaine said. &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t seen him for at least twenty years.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I remember being here,&#x201d; Barton said, &#x201c;but not how I got here or why.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; Lance said. He sat down and turned to his brother. &#x201c;Barton, I have to return to my office right now, but Stone, here, who is a good friend, is going to put you up at his house for a few days. You&#x2019;ll be very comfortable there.&#x201d; He slipped a card and some money into his jacket pocket. &#x201c;My number is there, if you need to reach me. We&#x2019;ll catch up in a few days.&#x201d;<br>Barton nodded. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s very good of you, Stone, to put me up,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;After all, I&#x2019;m a perfect stranger, even to myself.&#x201d;<br>Stone shrugged. &#x201c;Any brother of Lance&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br>Lance stood up and motioned for Stone to follow him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m very grateful for this, Stone,&#x201d; he said as they walked toward the door. He took a card from his pocket and scribbled a number on the back. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my cell number,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call you tomorrow to see how he is, but if there&#x2019;s any sort of emergency, you can reach me, night or day, at that number. He seems to be about your size; can you loan him some clothes?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure, but first let him have some dinner, then I&#x2019;ll get him home and to bed.&#x201d; They shook hands, and Lance went outside, got into a black SUV at the curb and was driven away.<br>Stone turned and went back to Barton Cabot&#x2019;s table. As he passed his own table he heard Genevieve and Dino.<br>&#x201c;If you would just tell me what this is about,&#x201d; Dino was pleading.<br>&#x201c;You know what it&#x2019;s about,&#x201d; Genevieve replied.<br>Stone kept walking. He sat down with Elaine and Barton and ordered some pasta, and the three of them had a quiet chat for a while. Barton kept up nicely, offered an opinion once in a while, and was charming, even witty. But he said nothing that seemed to require any direct memory of his circumstances.<br>Stone gave Barton his card, and he tucked it into a jacket pocket. &#x201c;Thank you, Stone,&#x201d; he said.<br>Well, Stone thought, at least he can remember my name. He excused himself to go to the men&#x2019;s room, and when he returned, both Barton and Elaine were no longer at the table. He saw Elaine sitting up front with some customers and walked up to her. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Barton?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&#x201c;He left,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Got into a cab. I put his dinner on your tab.&#x201d;<br>Stone hurried outside and looked up and down Second Avenue. There was no sign of Barton Cabot.<br>&#x201c;Oh, shit,&#x201d; he said aloud to himself.</p><p><b>3</b></p><p>Stone went back into Elaine&#x2019;s and sat down with Dino and Genevieve, both of whom, he was grateful to see, had fallen silent.<br>&#x201c;Dino, I need your help,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d better be going,&#x201d; Genevieve said, standing up.<br>&#x201c;No, don&#x2019;t go,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a night shift starting in a few minutes,&#x201d; she said. She pecked Stone on the cheek, fetched Dino a sweeping, openhanded blow to the back of the head, mussing his hair, and left.<br>&#x201c;Why do I think you got off light?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t know what it&#x2019;s about,&#x201d; Dino said, smoothing his hair.<br>&#x201c;You may never know,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;I need your help.&#x201d; He explained about Lance&#x2019;s brother.<br>&#x201c;And you let him walk out of here?&#x201d; Dino asked, incredulous.<br>&#x201c;I had to go to the john, all right? And besides, he was sitting, chatting with Elaine.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know Elaine spends her evening cruising tables.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Penguin 60s Classics</h2><p>1995. Penguin.

They abhor peace, the sole and rightful property of liberals. Right? Wrong.<br>&nbsp;<br>As Bill Kauffman makes clear, true conservatives have always resisted the imperial and military impulse: it drains the treasury, curtails domestic liberties, breaks down families, and vulgarizes culture. From the Federalists who opposed the War of 1812, to the striving of Robert Taft (known as "Mr. Republican") to keep the United States out of Korea, to the latter-day libertarian critics of the Iraq war, there has historically been nothing freakish, cowardly, or even unusual about antiwar activists on the political right. And while these critics of U.S. military crusades have been vilified by the party of George W. Bush, their conservative vision of a peaceful, decentralized, and noninterventionist America gives us a glimpse of the country we could have had--and might yet attain.<br>&nbsp;<br>Passionate and witty, <i>Ain't My America </i>is an eye-opening exploration of the forgotten history of right-wing peace movements--and a clarion manifesto for antiwar conservatives of today.</p><p>Bill Kauffman is the author of six books, most recently <i>Look Homeward America </i>(named one of the best books of 2006 by the American Library Association) and <i>America First</i>. (<i>Dispatches from the Muckdog Gazette</i>, 2004, is available from Picador in paperback.) Kauffman has written for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and <i>The American Conservative</i>, among other publications. He lives in upstate New York with his family.<p>Introduction</p><p>Left stands for peace, right for war; liberals are pacific, conservatives are bellicose. Or so one might conclude after surveying the dismal landscape of the American Right in the Age of Bush II.</p><p>Yet there is a long and honorable (if largely hidden) tradition of antiwar thought and action among the American Right. It stretches from ruffle-shirted Federalists who opposed the War of 1812 and civic-minded mugwump critics of the Spanish-American War on up through the midwestern isolationists who formed the backbone of the pre&#x2013;World War II America First Committee and the conservative Republicans who voted against U.S. involvement in NATO, the Korean conflict, and Vietnam. And although they are barely audible amid the belligerent clamor of today&#x2019;s shock-and-awe Right, libertarians and old-fashioned traditionalist conservatives are among the sharpest critics of the Iraq War and the imperial project of the Bush Republicans.</p><p>Derided as isolationists&#x2014;which, as that patriot of the Old Republic Gore Vidal has noted, means simply people who &#x201c;want no part of foreign wars&#x201d; and who &#x201c;want to be allowed to live their own lives without interference from government&#x201d;1&#x2014;the antiwar Right has put forth a critique of foreign intervention that is at once gimlet-eyed, idealistic, historically grounded, and dyed deeply in the American grain. Just because Bush, Rush, and Fox are ignorant of history doesn&#x2019;t mean authentic conservatives have to swallow the profoundly un-American American Empire.</p><p>Rooted in the Farewell Address of George Washington, informing such conservative-tinged antiwar movements as the Anti-Imperialist League, which said no to U.S. colonialism in the Philippines, finding poignant and prescient expression in the extraordinary valediction in which President Dwight Eisenhower warned his countrymen against the &#x201c;military-industrial complex,&#x201d; the conservative case against American Empire and militarism remains forceful and relevant. It is no museum piece, no artifact as inutile as it is quaint. It is plangent, wise, and deserving of revival. But before it can be revived, it must be disinterred.</p><p>A note, first, on taxonomy. To label is to libel, or at least to divest the subject of individuating contradictions and qualifications. I have found that the most interesting American political figures cannot be squeezed into the constricted and lifeless pens of liberal or conservative. Nor do I accept the simpleminded division of our lovely and variegated country into red and blue, for to paint Colorado, Kansas, and Alabama requires every color in the spectrum. Right and Left have outlived their usefulness as taxonomic distinctions. They&#x2019;re closer to prisons from which no thought can escape.</p><p>Yet the terms are as ubiquitous as good and evil, and in fact many on the Right do think, Latinately, of their side as dexterous and the Left as sinister. I say it&#x2019;s time for a little ambidexterity. So my &#x201c;Right&#x201d; is capacious enough to include Jeffersonian libertarians and Jefferson-hating Federalists, Senators Robert Taft and George McGovern (yes, yes; give me a chance), dirt-farm southern populists and Beacon Streeters who take hauteur with their tea and jam, cranky Nebraska tax cutters and eccentric Michigan tellers of ghostly tales, little old ladies in tennis shoes marching against the United Nations and free-market economists protesting the draft. My subjects are, in the main, suspicious of state power, crusades, bureaucracy, and a modernity that is armed and dangerous. They are anti-expansion, pro-particularism, and so genuinely &#x201c;conservative&#x201d;&#x2014;that is, cherishing of the verities, of home and hearth and family&#x2014;as to make them mortal (immortal?) enemies of today&#x2019;s neoconservatives.</p><p>Above all, they have feared empire, whose properties were enumerated well by the doubly pen-named Garet Garrett: novelist, exponent of free enterprise and individualism, and a once-reliable if unspectacular stable horse for the Saturday Evening Post. Writing in 1953, he set down a quintet of imperial requisites.</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The executive power of the government shall be dominant.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Domestic policy becomes subordinate to foreign policy.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ascendancy of the military mind, to such a point at last that the civilian mind is intimidated.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A system of satellite nations.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A complex of vaunting and fear.2</p><p>Between &#x201c;Constitutional, representative, limited government, on the one hand, and Empire on the other hand, there is mortal enmity,&#x201d;3 wrote Garrett, who did not burst with confidence that the former would vanquish the latter. He wrote in the final days of the Truman administration. The executive bestrode the U.S. polity. Militarism and the cult of bigness held sway. The blood rivers of Europe had yet to run dry. More than fifty thousand American boys had died&#x2014;for what?&#x2014;on the Korean peninsula. Truman had refused to obtain from Congress a formal declaration of war; future presidents would follow suit. The dark night of Cold War was upon us. This was what our forebears had warned against.</p><p>Why did these men (and later women) of the &#x201c;Right&#x201d; oppose expansion, war, and empire? And, in contemporary America, where have all the followers gone?</p><p>From the Republic&#x2019;s beginning, Americans of conservative temperament have been skeptical of manifest destiny and crusades for democracy. They have agreed with Daniel Webster that &#x201c;there must be some limit to the extent of our territory, if we are to make our institutions permanent. The Government is very likely to be endangered . . . by a further enlargement of its already vast territorial surface.&#x201d;4 Is it really worth trading in the Republic for southwestern scrubland? Webster&#x2019;s point was remade, just as futilely, by the Anti-Imperialist League. It was repeated by those conservatives who supplied virtually the only opposition to the admission of Hawaii and Alaska to the Union. As the Texas Democrat Kenneth M. Regan told the House when he vainly argued against stitching a forty-ninth star on the flag, &#x201c;I fear for the future of the country if we start taking in areas far from our own shores that we will have to protect with our money, our guns, and our men, instead of staying here and looking after the heritage we were left by George Washington, who told us to beware of any foreign entanglements.&#x201d;5</p><p>Expansion was madness. John Greenleaf Whittier compared its advocates to hashish smokers.</p><p>The man of peace, about whose dreams</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweet millennial angels cluster,</p><p>Tastes the mad weed, and plots and schemes,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A raving Cuban filibuster!6</p><p>George W. Bush, it is rumored, preferred coke to hash, but his utopian vision of an American behemoth splayed across the globe would be, to conservatives of eras past, a hideous nightmare.</p><p>Robert Nisbet, the social critic who was among the wisest and most laureled of American conservatives, wrote in his coruscant Conservatism: Dream and Reality (1986): &#x201c;Of all the misascriptions of the word &#x2018;conservative&#x2019; during the last four years, the most amusing, in an historical light, is surely the application of &#x2018;conservative&#x2019; to the [budget-busting enthusiasts for great increases in military expenditures]. For in America throughout the twentieth century, and including four substantial wars abroad, conservatives had been steadfastly the voices of non-inflationary military budgets, and of an emphasis on trade in the world instead of American nationalism. In the two World Wars, in Korea, and in Viet Nam, the leaders of American entry into war were such renowned liberal-progressives as Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy. In all four episodes conservatives, both in the national government and in the rank and file, were largely hostile to intervention.&#x201d;7</p><p>In the two decades since Nisbet&#x2019;s observation the historical amnesia has descended into a kind of belligerent nescience. Today&#x2019;s self-identified conservatives loathe, detest, and slander any temerarious soul who speaks for peace. FDR and Truman join Ronald Reagan in the trinity of favorite presidents of the contemporary Right; those atavistic Old Rightists who harbor doubts about U.S. entry into the world wars or our Asian imbroglios (scripted, launched, and propagandized for by liberal Democrats) are dismissed as cranks or worse. Vice President Dick Cheney, lamenting the August 2006 primary defeat of the Scoop Jackson Democratic senator Joseph Lieberman, charged that the Democrats wanted to &#x201c;retreat behind our oceans&#x201d;8&#x2014;which an earlier generation of peace-minded Republicans had considered a virtuous policy consistent with George Washington&#x2019;s adjuration to avoid entanglements and alliances with foreign nations.</p><p>Felix Morley, the Washington Post editorialist who would have been a top foreign-policy official in the Robert Taft administration, wrote in 1959: &#x201c;Every war in which the United States has engaged since 1815 was waged in the name of democracy. Each has contributed to that centralization of power which tends to destroy that local self-government which is what most Americans have in mind when they acclaim democracy.&#x201d;9 Alas, Dick Cheney, the draft-dodging hawk, the anti-gay-marriage grandfather of a tribade-baby, is not an irony man.</p><p>I will consider the anti-expansionists of the early Republic in the first chapter. My focus in this book, however, is on &#x201c;conservative&#x201d; anti-imperialists of the twentieth century&#x2014;the American Century, as that rootless son of missionaries Henry Luce dubbed it. The men and women whom I shall profile regarded Lucian expansion, conquest, and war&#x2014;whether in the Philippines in 1900 or Vietnam in 1968&#x2014;as profoundly un-American, even anti-American. The American Century, alas, did not belong to the likes of Moorfield Storey, Murray Rothbard, or Russell Kirk. But the American soul does.</p><p>These brave men and women also insisted, in the face of obloquy and smears, that dissent is a patriotic imperative. For questioning the drive to war in 1941, Charles Lindbergh would be called a Nazi by the FDR hatchet man Harold Ickes, and for challenging the constitutionality of Harry Truman&#x2019;s Korean conflict, Senator Robert Taft would be slandered as a commie symp by The New Republic. Patrick J. Buchanan would be libeled as an anti-Semite for noting the role that Israel&#x2019;s supporters played in driving the United States into the two (the first two?) invasions of Iraq, and the full range of anti&#x2013;Iraq War right-wingers would be condemned as &#x201c;unpatriotic conservatives&#x201d; by National Review in April 2003. Same as it ever was. As Senator Taft lamented in January 1951 during the brief but illuminating &#x201c;Great Debate&#x201d; over Korea and NATO strategy between hawkish liberal Democrats and peace-minded conservative Republicans, &#x201c;Criticisms are met by the calling of names rather than by intelligent debate.&#x201d;10</p><p>In pre-imperial America, conservatives objected to war and empire out of jealous regard for personal liberties, a balanced budget, the free enterprise system, and federalism. These concerns came together under the umbrella of the badly misunderstood America First Committee, the largest popular antiwar organization in U.S. history. The AFC was formed in 1940 to keep the United States out of a second European war that many Americans feared would be a repeat of the first. Numbering eight hundred thousand members who ranged from populist to patrician, from Main Street Republican to prairie socialist, America First embodied and acted upon George Washington&#x2019;s Farewell Address counsel to pursue a foreign policy of neutrality.</p><p>As the America Firsters discovered, protesting war is a lousy career move. Dissenters are at best calumniated, at worst thrown in jail: for standing against foreign wars and the drive thereto Eugene V. Debs was imprisoned (World War I), Martin Luther King Jr. was painted red and spied upon (Vietnam War), and those who have spoken and acted against the Bush-Cheney Iraq War have been subject to a drearily predictable array of insults and indignities.</p><p>It has long been so. Edgar Lee Masters, the Spoon River Anthology poet and states&#x2019;-rights Democrat who threw away his career by writing a splenetic biography of Abraham Lincoln decrying Honest Abe as a guileful empire builder, recalled of the Spanish-American War: &#x201c;There was great opposition to the war over the country, but at that time an American was permitted to speak out against a war if he chose to do so.&#x201d;11 Masters had lived through the frenzied persecutions of antiwar dissidents under the liberal Democrat Woodrow Wilson. He had little patience with gilded platitudes about wars for human rights and the betterment of the species. He knew that war meant death and taxes, those proverbial inevitabilities that become shining virtues in the fog of martial propaganda. Masters, in the argot of today&#x2019;s war party and its publicists, was a traitor, a cringing treasonous abettor of America&#x2019;s (and freedom&#x2019;s!) enemies.</p><p>Yet Masters and his ilk were American to the core, and the antiwar Middle Americanism they represented has never really gone away. It surfaced even during Vietnam, that showpiece war of the best and brightest establishment liberal Democrats. Although most conservative Republicans were gung-ho on Vietnam, discarding their erstwhile preference for limited constitutional government, the right-wing antiwar banner was carried by such libertarians as Murray Rothbard (who sought, creatively, to fuse Old Right with New Left in an antiwar popular front) and the penny-pinching Iowa Republican congressman H. R. Gross, who said nay to the war on the simple if not wholly adequate grounds that it cost too much.</p><p>The Iraq wars of the Presidents Bush have rekindled the old antiwar spirit of the Right, though it is easy to miss in the glare of the bombs bursting in the Mesopotamian air. Indeed, Bush Republicans and pro-war Democrats have fretted mightily over recent surveys from the Council on Foreign Relations showing that the American people are reverting to&#x2014;horrors!&#x2014;isolationism, which the CFR defines invidiously as a hostility toward foreigners but which I see as a wholesome, pacific, and very American reluctance to intervene in the political and military quarrels of other nations.</p><p>The old American isolationism endures, despite the slurs, despite its utter absence within the corridors of power. President George W. Bush, as messianically interventionist a chief executive as we have ever endured, took out after the bogeyman in his 2006 State of the Union address: &#x201c;Our enemies and our friends can be certain: The United States will not retreat from the world, and we will never surrender to evil. America rejects the false comfort of isolationism.&#x201d;12 And America, or rather its masters, chooses the bloody road of expansion and war.</p><p>The men who write the words that thud from Bush&#x2019;s mouth felt compelled to rebuke nameless isolationists because, as a Pew Research Center survey of October 2005 found, 42 percent of Americans agreed that the U.S. &#x201c;should mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.&#x201d; ...</p></p><h2>Take, Burn or Destroy (A Charles Hayden Novel)</h2><p><b>Master and Commander Charles Hayden returns in the riveting new seafaring adventure from the bestselling author.</b><br><br>1794, the height of the French Revolution&#x2014;Charles Hayden sets off aboard the ill-fated HMS Themis with orders to destroy a French frigate sailing from Le Havre and to gather intelligence from a royalist spy.

Being held in port by human agency, however, as Hayden&#x2019;s ship was, provoked quite a different response. Mr Barthe stomped about the decks impressing his juniors with his command of the English language, most especially the strain that could not be used in the presence of ladies. The other sea officers were not so vocal but peevish and too easily vexed, which was quickly sensed by the hands, who modified their behaviour accordingly.</p><p>It was Hayden&#x2019;s most urgent desire to get his ship under way on the morrow at first light and be out of Plymouth Sound and into the Channel before the decks were dry. But the forenoon had passed without the awaited permission arriving and now the afternoon was well advanced, the day speeding.</p><p>What had the First Secretary said?<i> I want you at sea&#x2014;and beyond recall&#x2014;as soon as can be arranged.</i> These words sent a little shiver through Hayden&#x2019;s entire being. &#x201c;Beyond recall&#x201d; were the words he found most ominous. Beyond recall of whom?</p><p>If only the Port Admiral would co-operate. The man&#x2019;s tardiness in granting Hayden&#x2019;s request to sail was madding if not peculiar. It caused Hayden to wonder if the Port Admiral served the designs of the &#x201c;enemies&#x201d; Hayden had been informed he possessed and if <i>that</i> was the reason the man was so dilatory in granting Hayden&#x2019;s request; orders from Whitehall Street were expected momentarily that would see him removed of his command.</p><p>Such were the thoughts that forced their way into a man&#x2019;s mind after the First Secretary informed him that if he did not accept this command it might never be within the First Secretary&#x2019;s power to gain him a comparable appointment again. Such words did speak of secret forces working against him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. did they not?</p><p>Hayden, however, was aware that his mind was not performing as it should and might be making much of nothing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or not nearly enough of what appeared to be very little. His estrangement from Henrietta had made sleep all but impossible, his stomach approved neither food nor drink, and his thoughts could hardly be turned to the matters at hand. Some part of him hoped he <i>would</i> suddenly be relieved of his command that he might return to London, find Henrietta, and have an explanation with her about the recent false claims of the Bourdages&#x2014;mother and daughter.</p><p>Hayden paced across his cabin, glancing out of the stern gallery windows now and again, across Plymouth Harbour to fields on the eastern shore. The new green of spring grass rippled in the breeze&#x2014;a fair breeze for Le Havre, to which place Hayden had been ordered to take or destroy a frigate using that harbour as a base from which to harass British shipping.</p><p>A knock on his door interrupted Hayden&#x2019;s thoughts, somewhat to his relief, as they had been tracing this same circle for several hours.</p><p>At a word from Hayden, his marine sentry cracked open the door.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr Barthe, sir&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Send him in.&#x201d;</p><p>The sailing master, all corpulence and jowls a-jiggle, waddled in, ancient hat tucked beneath his arm revealing a head of red and grey&#x2014;ash and flame.</p><p>&#x201c;Please do not tell me, Mr Barthe, that you have discovered some fatal wound to our rig.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Our rigging is all in order, sir, most perfectly so. And our sails are bent and ready to loose, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; The sailing master hesitated.</p><p>&#x201c;Do complete your sentence, Mr Barthe, the suspense is almost more than I can bear.&#x201d;</p><p>Barthe smiled. &#x201c;If we are not to sail this day, sir, Mrs Barthe and my daughters would like very much to visit the ship. Mr Wickham has kindly arranged a boat to carry them out, sir, if that would be acceptable.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did Mr Archer not inform you that we have yet to complete our powder?&#x201d;</p><p>Barthe was genuinely surprised. &#x201c;He most certainly did not, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For which I have no explanation. The powder hoy is to visit us this very afternoon. I still hope to win our anchor at first light tomorrow and be in the Channel by breakfast.&#x201d;</p><p>Barthe did not hide his disappointment at all well. &#x201c;Perhaps&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perhaps Mr Archer did inform me about the powder hoy, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr Barthe, it is very obvious that you are attempting to conceal Mr Archer&#x2019;s lapse, but I shall have to have a word with him about it. As to Mrs Barthe and all the Misses Barthe, I am almost as sorry as you that they cannot visit the ship. Please send Mrs Barthe my regrets and explain the reason; I should not want her to feel the least unwelcome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I shall, sir. Thank you, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Barthe&#x2019;s ample bottom retreated out of the door. Hayden was sure every man aboard would be very disappointed to learn that Mrs Barthe would not be bringing her handsome daughters for a visit&#x2014;even Hayden felt a little chagrin.</p><p>Allowing the sailing master a moment to make his exit, Hayden then opened the door. &#x201c;Pass the word for Mr Archer, if you please,&#x201d; he ordered the marine.</p><p>Hayden looked at the mass of paperwork that lay in untidy piles upon his desk. If only his mind would consent to focus on it for more than five minutes before returning to Henrietta and his distressing financial troubles.</p><p>A respectful knock on the door announced the arrival of Mr Archer. The lieutenant came striding quickly in.</p><p>&#x201c;I am sorry, sir, it was entirely my failure to inform Mr Barthe. He did not for a moment forget.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And it is a very serious failure, Mr Archer. How is Mr Barthe to plan his work without such knowledge?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do not know, sir. I shall not let such a thing happen again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am quite certain you will not. Fires have been extinguished all about the ship?&#x201d;</p><p>Archer tried not to display offence at this but failed. &#x201c;All but the lamp in the light room, sir. And I have ordered wet blankets draped about that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go through the ship and be certain that we have no fires lit, Mr Archer. As to Mr Barthe&#x2019;s family, or any other visitors to the ship, I should not want to take the chance of blasting them to hell. Would you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir, I would not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then be about your business, Mr Archer.&#x201d;</p><p>The lieutenant went stiffly out. Although Hayden did not enjoy the role of angry captain, he had come to the belief over the years that the occasional upbraiding kept young officers on their toes and alert to their duties. It had certainly had that effect upon him. Archer&#x2019;s pride would be stung for a day or two, but Hayden was certain he would get over it and be better for it as well. There was a small part of Hayden that wondered if he was merely being peevish&#x2014;a result of his own distress and anxiety about his personal and professional life&#x2014;and this thought was not easily dismissed. He <i>was</i> peevish, he knew; the slightest things sent his choler soaring. But then, Archer&#x2019;s mistake was fairly grave and could not have been passed over without comment. He bloody well <i>should</i> have informed the sailing master that the powder hoy was expected. What had he been thinking?</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps he was distracted by his personal life,&#x201d; Hayden muttered. &#x201c;As have you been, Captain.&#x201d;</p><p>For a moment he sank down on the bench before the windows, his mind deflecting away from duty of its own volition, and wondered again if his letter would reach Henrietta and if she would read it. His greatest worry was that she might simply burn it or toss it away out of anger with him for what she believed was his betrayal&#x2014;his reputed marriage to a French �migr�e. It was a source of the utmost frustration to him that he could not have a five-minute explanation with her that would clear away all misunderstandings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but he had not been able to find her while he was in London and neither Lady Hertle, Henrietta&#x2019;s aunt, nor Mrs Hertle, her cousin and confidante, would consent to speak with him.</p><p>Yet another knock upon his door interrupted this too familiar train of thought.</p><p>&#x201c;Boat alongside with orders from the Port Admiral,&#x201d; Midshipman Gould reported when the door was opened.</p><p>Hayden arose from the constant feeling of enervation and weight bearing down upon him and went quickly up the ladder to the deck, where he found Lieutenant Ransome speaking sharply to an unknown young officer of the same rank.</p><p>&#x201c;The Port Admiral requires your signature, Captain,&#x201d; he said as Hayden appeared. &#x201c;Mine, apparently, will not answer.&#x201d; Ransome, who had been put aboard his ship by no less a personage than Admiral Lord Hood, had the kind of pride that was rather too easily wounded&#x2014;a trait that Hayden found aggravating in a lieutenant, and especially so today.</p><p>Hayden signed the papers without comment, and discovered not just orders from the Port Admiral but a second letter from the Admiralty. He felt a need to sit, suddenly, and retreated below to the privacy of his cabin.</p><p>Sinking down into the chair at his desk, Hayden held the two letters a moment wondering which he would open first. A letter from the Admiralty was the more likely to contain bad news.</p><p>If only the Port Admiral had given me permission to sail! Hayden thought.</p><p>A moment more of wondering, his mind racing, and then Hayden came down on the side of the letter from the Admiralty. It was from Philip Stephens, and in the Secretary&#x2019;s own hand too. It was prefaced as &#x201c;Most Secret and Confidential.&#x201d;</p><p><i>My Dear Captain Hayden;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>You are hereby ordered, at the earliest opportunity of wind and weather, to take HMS Themis and proceed off the harbour of Le Havre on the night of April the 12th. At two of the morning of April the 13th, at a distance no greater than one mile due west of the headland, you must show a single light, visible to the shore, for one half of the hour. A small boat shall approach carrying an individual who will identify himself as &#x201c;Monsieur Beno�t.&#x201d; He will bear information of a sensitive nature essential to the prosecution of the present war. This intelligence must then be conveyed to the Admiralty with all speed and in a manner that will not compromise the identity of its source. If this task conflicts with previous orders given to you by me, meeting Monsieur Beno�t and reporting his intelligence to the Admiralty shall take precedence. These orders should not be communicated to your officers until such time as they require the information and certainly not until you are at sea and well out of sight of our shores.</i></p><p>The letter was signed &#x201c;Philip Stephens, First Secretary.&#x201d; Hayden laid it down for a moment on his desk and then cursed loud enough for his sentry no doubt to have heard. It was like the Admiralty to give him additional orders that would make the execution of his previous duties difficult if not impossible. He was also frustrated because taking a frigate could mean prize money, which, given his recent reverses, he desperately required. Meeting a spy did nothing but put his ship in danger, given that the spy could very easily be apprehended and questioned before Hayden arrived and the time and place of their rendezvous then be made known to the French authorities.</p><p>He cursed again, this time under his breath. Breaking the seal on the second letter, he found his request to sail finally had been granted. Any thoughts that he might be returned to land and the possibility of a rapprochement with Henrietta must be given over. He was for Le Havre and a meeting with the mysterious Monsieur Beno�t. He cursed this particular gentleman in French.</p> <p></p><p></p><p>Two</p><p>A malformed moon drifted above the haze and cast a meagre light upon the deck. Beyond the rail, an inky, restive sea rolled and muttered in its bed.</p><p>&#x201c;It is an unwholesome sea.&#x201d; The sailing master appeared out of darkness, stomping the few feet to the bulwark where Charles Hayden stood with a night glass tucked into the crook of his arm.</p><p>&#x201c;Unwholesome? Whatever do you mean, Mr Barthe?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It seems like a broth left to stand until it has gone thick and chill.&#x201d; Barthe shivered visibly.</p><p>Hayden hid a smile. &#x201c;I believe you are becoming somewhat of a poet, Mr Barthe. It is just the usual April sea, to my eye. Though the night is too close by half.&#x201d; He raised his glass and swept it very slowly across sixty degrees of arc, then back again, before returning it to its place of rest.</p><p>&#x201c;Three hours yet, Captain, before we have some light,&#x201d; Barthe observed, divining what was in his superior&#x2019;s mind. &#x201c;Time yet.&#x201d;</p><p>Hayden did not think it was near enough time and wanted to be under sail even as they spoke.</p><p>&#x201c;I would rather see them returned sooner than later,&#x201d; Hayden replied. &#x201c;And as for the other matter&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That man might be in gaol or on his way to the guillotine. I shall not wait past the appointed time.&#x201d;</p><p>A cutter, still painted black from their recent enterprise on the island of Corsica, had set out some hours earlier to enter the French harbour of Le Havre under cover of darkness. Whether the frigate Hayden was to destroy had gone out on the hunt that night, Hayden needed to know. There was no way to intercept it along the British coast, where it stalked its prey under cover of darkness&#x2014;other than by matchless luck&#x2014;so Hayden hoped to meet with Monsieur Beno�t and then lie in wait for the frigate&#x2019;s return. If, however, the French ship remained in harbour that night, Hayden did not want to lose the element of surprise by being observed lying in ambush. In that case, Hayden would order the <i>Themis</i> to slip away long before first light to take no chance of being becalmed within plain sight of the French port.</p><p>But for now he must meet this damned &#x201c;Monsieur Beno�t,&#x201d; who, if he had been discovered by the French, could easily give away the time and place of this rendezvous, in which case French ships might keep the appointment instead, which caused Hayden more than a little uneasiness.</p><p>&#x201c;Can you make out the coast, Captain?&#x201d; the sailing master wondered, his voice suddenly a bit thin. &#x201c;I fear we are being set to the east. This is no place for a ship on such a dark night. When the Seine fills, upon the rise, the currents can shift inshore, and the duration of high water is often prolonged. I have seen currents set a ship counter to the best pilot&#x2019;s predictions. It is a damned dangerous situation, and I am not pleased with it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We are of one mind in this, Mr Barthe, but we have no choice in this matter.&#x201d; Hayden tu...</p></p><h2>401(k) Sales Champion: A Guide For Financial Advisors to Acquire and Retain 401(k) Plans</h2><p>New Hardcover w/dust cover 1st Edition, still in plastic wrapped, in great condition.

But as time passed, and the sun shone, and the rain fell, the little seed began to feel something unexpected. . . .</p><p>Subtitled a "Story of Encouragement for All Ages," the <i>Trellis and the Seed</i> tells the story of how "God has planned something beautiful" for even the tiniest, most unassuming little seed.<p> The tiny seed begins its mysterious journey in the hands of the seemingly omnipotent "Nice Lady," who predicts--much to the seed's disbelief--that it will make a "beautiful vine with sweet-smelling blossoms." Even as the Nice Lady plants the seed, erects an ambitious trellis, waits for rain, adds fertilizer, and performs all her other nurserial oblations, the seed continues to be baffled by its caretaker's faith. ("It was only a seed, and very, very small. How could it ever be a beautiful vine with blossoms?") How indeed? Suffice it to say, God doesn't send a crafty bird to eat the seed in a harrowing third-act changeup.</p><p> Jan Karon's story of patience and faith shows the same folksy charm that infuses her <i>Mitford Years</i> series, and her gentle words find a soothing complement in the skilled, muted watercolors of Robert Gantt Steele (of the <i>Her Story</i> series). (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p><b>Jan Karon</b>, born Janice Meredith Wilson in the foothills of North Carolina, was named after the title of a popular novel, Janice Meredith.<p>Jan wrote her first novel at the age of ten. "The manuscript was written on Blue Horse notebook paper, and was, for good reason, kept hidden from my sister. When she found it, she discovered the one curse word I had, with pounding heart, included in someone's speech. For Pete's sake, hadn't Rhett Butler used that very same word and gotten away with it? After my grandmother's exceedingly focused reproof, I've written books without cussin' ever since."</p><p>Several years ago, Karon left a successful career in advertising to move to the mountain village of Blowing Rock, North Carolina, and write books. "I stepped out on faith to follow my lifelong dream of being an author," she says. "I made real sacrifices and took big risks. But living, it seems to me, is largely about risk."</p><p>Enthusiastic booksellers across the country have introduced readers of all ages to Karon's heartwarming books. <i>At Home in Mitford</i>, Karon's first book in the Mitford series, was nominated for an ABBY by the American Booksellers Association in 1996 and again in 1997. Bookstore owner, Shirley Sprinkle, says, "The Mitford Books have been our all-time fiction bestsellers since we went in business twenty-five years ago. We've sold 10,000 of Jan's books and don't see any end to the Mitford phenomenon."</p></p><h2>The Early Fears</h2><p>Robert Bloch (b. 1917) began his writing career as a teenager in 1935. While his early work was deeply influenced by the style and concepts of his mentor, H.P. Lovecraft, it did not take him very long to develop his own literary voice. Prolific and versatile, he expanded from horror to science fiction and suspense, from short stories and novels to script writing for radio, television, and cinema. Along the way he has won nearly every award and honor the field has to bestow. <br><br>"The Early Fears' brings together for the first time all of the stories from his first two short stories collections, both long out-of-print, plus three previously uncollected stories - 39 stories in all. Included are such classics as 'Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper,' 'Enoch,' 'The Opener of the Way,' and the Hugo Award winning 'That Hell-Bound Train.'</p><p></p><h2>Einstein&#39;s Dreams</h2><p>A modern classic, Einstein&#39;s Dreams is a fictional collage of stories dreamed by Albert Einstein in 1905, when he worked in a patent office in Switzerland. As the defiant but sensitive young genius is creating his theory of relativity, a new conception of time, he imagines many possible worlds. In one, time is circular, and people are fated to repeat their triumphs and failures over and over. In another, there is a place where time stands still, visited by lovers and parents clinging to their children. In another, time is a nightingale, sometimes trapped by a bell jar.</p><p>If you liked the eerie whimsy of Italo Calvino's <i>Invisible Cities</i>, Steven Millhauser's <i>Little Kingdoms</i>, or Jorge Luis Borges's <i>Labyrinths</i>, you will love Alan Lightman's ethereal yet down-to-earth book <i>Einstein's Dreams</i>. Lightman teaches physics and writing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, helping bridge the light-year-size gap between science and the humanities, the enemy camps C.P. Snow famously called <i>The Two Cultures</i>.<p> <i>Einstein's Dreams</i> became a bestseller by delighting both scientists and humanists. It is technically a novel. Lightman uses simple, lyrical, and literal details to locate Einstein precisely in a place and time--Berne, Switzerland, spring 1905, when he was a patent clerk privately working on his bizarre, unheard-of theory of relativity. The town he perceives is vividly described, but the waking Einstein is a bit player in this drama.</p><p> The book takes flight when Einstein takes to his bed and we share his dreams, 30 little fables about places where time behaves quite differently. In one world, time is circular; in another a man is occasionally plucked from the present and deposited in the past: "He is agonized. For if he makes the slightest alteration in anything, he may destroy the future ... he is forced to witness events without being part of them ... an inert gas, a ghost ... an exile of time." The dreams in which time flows backward are far more sophisticated than the time-tripping scenes in Kurt Vonnegut's <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, though science-fiction fans may yearn for a sustained yarn, which Lightman declines to provide. His purpose is simply to study the different kinds of time in Einstein's mind, each with its own lucid consequences. In their tone and quiet logic, Lightman's fables come off like Bach variations played on an exquisite harpsichord. People live for one day or eternity, and they respond intelligibly to each unique set of circumstances. Raindrops hang in the air in a place of frozen time; in another place everyone knows one year in advance exactly when the world will end, and acts accordingly.</p><p> "Consider a world in which cause and effect are erratic," writes Lightman. "Scientists turn reckless and mutter like gamblers who cannot stop betting.... In this world, artists are joyous." In another dream, time slows with altitude, causing rich folks to build stilt homes on mountaintops, seeking eternal youth and scorning the swiftly aging poor folk below. Forgetting eventually how they got there and why they subsist on "all but the most gossamer food," the higher-ups at length "become thin like the air, bony, old before their time."</p><p> There is no plot in this small volume--it's more like a poetry collection than a novel. Like Stephen Hawking's <i>A Brief History of Time</i>, it's a mind-stretching meditation by a scientist who's been to the far edge of physics and is back with wilder tales than Marco Polo's. And unlike many admirers of Hawking, readers of <i>Einstein's Dreams</i> have a high probability of actually finishing it.</p>Now available:&nbsp;&nbsp;New signed, boxed edition!<br><br>An imaginary re-creation of Einstein's discovery of the nature of time, this novel takes us through the young patent clerk's many dreams depicting compelling conceptions of time.</p><h2>The Praetor&#39;s Dungeon (Tros of Samothrace, Vol 3)</h2><p>The Praetor&#39;s Dungeon (Tros of Samothrace, Vol 3) [Paperback] [Jan 01, 1976] Mundy, Talbot</p><p></p><h2>Gator: My Life in Pinstripes</h2><p><b><b>Legendary New York Yankees pitcher Ron Guidry recounts his years playing for one of the most storied and celebrated teams in sports history--the world champion New York Yankees during their heyday in the Bronx Zoo years, with manic manager Billy Martin, headline loving owner George Steinbrenner, and an ego-driven all-star cast that included everyone from slugger Reggie Jackson and All star catcher Thurman Munson to Cy Young Award winners Sparky Lyle and Catfish Hunter.</b></b><br><br>Ron Guidry, known as Gator and Louisiana Lightning to his teammates, quickly rose in 1977 to become the ace of the Yankees' stellar pitching staff, helping the team regarded as the most famous and notorious in Yankee history win the World Series.

He talks poignantly about the death of Thurman Munson in 1979, and the impact that had on Ron and on the club. He tells stories about players like Lou Pinella, Willie Randolph, Bucky Dent, Catfish Hunter, Chris Chambliss, and Mickey Rivers, and coach Yogi Berra (who in 1984 became the Yankees' manager) and Elston Howard.</p><p><b>RON GUIDRY</b> is one of the most beloved players in Yankee history.

George always wanted to let you know how he felt. Sometimes he wanted to cuss at you. He liked it if you cussed back at him. He wanted to motivate you. To him, the cussing and the motivating were one and the same. It happened to so many guys, so many days. Especially this season. But this wasn&#x2019;t just any other day during the 1978 New York Yankees season. This was hours before the biggest game of the year. One of the biggest games in Yankees history. Arguably one of the biggest games in baseball history. George being George, the loudmouthed, pushy, in-your-face owner of the Yankees, he wanted to have words with his starting pitcher before the game. That starting pitcher was me. And I wanted none of it.</p><p><i>&#x201c;WHERE&#x2019;S GATOR!?&#x201d;</i> he bellowed.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t a question so much as a demand. If he wanted to talk to you, he expected an audience. In a couple of hours, we were set to play a one-game tiebreaker to decide the American League East. This was the first tiebreaker since baseball adopted divisions in 1969. And it wasn&#x2019;t against just any team. It was against the Boston Red Sox.</p><p>The game was straight out of a Hollywood script. Forget all of our internal mayhem from that season&#x2014;the constant drama surrounding Reggie Jackson, the departure of our fiery and disagreeable manager, Billy Martin, and more. Boston against New York transcended all of that. There was the historical aspect: the Curse of the Bambino and the Red Sox spending decades, over half a century, nipping at our heels. There was what had happened this year: baseball&#x2019;s &#x201c;Boston Massacre,&#x201d; in which the Red Sox led the division by fourteen games during the middle of the summer, only to give it away. Then, in the final week, they won eight in a row to tie it back up on the very last day. We were both 99&#x2013;63. A coin was flipped, and the tiebreaker would be played at Fenway Park. A 163rd game in a 162-game season. One game to settle it all.</p><p><i>&#x201c;WHERE&#x2019;S GATOR!?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i>My teammates didn&#x2019;t know where I was. Neither did our manager, Bob Lemon. Only one person in the clubhouse, our trainer, Gene Monahan, knew where I was hiding out. I had snuck into the training room to take a nap. I lay down beneath the training table, and Geno threw a couple of sheets over it so nobody could see me. People popped in and out of the office asking Geno if he had seen me. Geno shrugged and said he hadn&#x2019;t. When George got around to asking him, Geno said I might be collecting my thoughts out on the field. So off George went, furiously stomping around the dewy Fenway grass in search of his starting pitcher. Meanwhile, I was sound asleep.</p><p>I knew George would be coming for me. But I didn&#x2019;t need anybody screaming at me. I knew exactly how big this game was; nobody had to remind me. So I didn&#x2019;t read the papers. If I was watching TV and a story about the game came up, I&#x2019;d change the channel. I knew the entire country would be watching. Red Sox broadcaster Ned Martin said it best. &#x201c;If there is anything going on in the world today,&#x201d; he mused, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what it is.&#x201d;</p><p>There were a bunch of reasons I could&#x2019;ve been worried. Probably should&#x2019;ve been worried. The Red Sox were every bit as good as us. The ninety-nine wins apiece said it all. Normally, ninety-nine wins would have won the division running away. Their lineup may have been the best in baseball. And they were red hot, winners of eight in a row. Moreover, the game was being played on their turf, Fenway Park. I was pitching on three days of rest, as opposed to my customary four. I knew I wouldn&#x2019;t have my best stuff.</p><p>But every step that had led me to this point in the season told me to ignore all of that. If you get caught up in it, you&#x2019;re likely to forget what your job is. I was brought up to be self-reliant and patient, something my long road to the majors reinforced, like crossbeams in a renovation. That&#x2019;s the reason I was here. That I was able to take a nap underneath the training table two hours before the first pitch should tell you everything you need to know about how worried I was.</p><p>The 1978 Yankees season might have been the most famous soap opera in baseball history. The lead actors in the drama: owner George Steinbrenner, who fought and fired his manager, Billy Martin, after Billy told the press that Reggie Jackson and George deserved each other&#x2014;one&#x2019;s a liar, the other&#x2019;s convicted. The manager who feuded with his players, suspending Reggie for five days after a game against Kansas City in which Reggie defied Billy by attempting to bunt. The players who butted heads with one another. The hurt feelings and catfights. The drama had a full complement of characters. Come to think of it, I&#x2019;m not sure whether it was a soap opera or a three-ringed circus. And it all took place on the biggest stage in sports, New York City, and on the most popular team in the history of America&#x2019;s national pastime. The fireworks and explosions rocked the entire country, on the front and back pages of the newspapers, on television, and on sports radio.</p><p>In the span of a couple of years I had gone from relative anonymity&#x2014;a good old boy from Lafayette, Louisiana&#x2014;to become the ace of the pitching staff. I knew the team depended on me, as much as anybody, to win. On the other hand, I was never the source of the team&#x2019;s drama. The reasons varied, but other folks&#x2014;from Reggie to Billy to George to Sparky Lyle&#x2014;were central figures of the discontent. I didn&#x2019;t have a beef with anybody. I tended to keep to myself and focus on doing my job in the best way I knew how. But that didn&#x2019;t mean I didn&#x2019;t observe what was going on. I was never far from it, but because I wasn&#x2019;t personally involved, I felt like I had the right distance to get some perspective about not just what happened but why it turned out the way it did&#x2014;with us winning it all. You see, I&#x2019;m not sure we would have won the World Series if all of that didn&#x2019;t go down. We may not have won if Billy remained our manager. We may not have won if our guys had issues but didn&#x2019;t hash them out.</p><p>The postmortems of the 1978 team centered on one fundamental question: How the heck did such a dysfunctional cast of stars and misfits manage to win it all? An ESPN miniseries about the team was called <i>The Bronx Is Burning</i>. Reliever Sparky Lyle wrote a book about the team, called <i>The Bronx Zoo,</i> that spent half a year on the bestseller lists. And so forth. In other words, you wouldn&#x2019;t blame anyone for thinking that we had no business winning the World Series. You&#x2019;d expect the story of the 1978 Yankees to be a narrative of a dysfunctional team going down in flames.</p><p>But that didn&#x2019;t happen. The way I see it, the 1978 Yankees didn&#x2019;t win <i>in spite</i> of what went down that season. We won <i>because </i>of what happened. A team that is willing to fight&#x2014;even one another&#x2014;can go one of two ways: into the toilet or into greatness. A team that is afraid of conflict can settle into complacency. That was not us. We were a team with the potential to be great. And I believe that out of all the craziness, we became a team that was both talented and fearless. We were hungry. We were relentless. We were fiercely competitive. And we came together as a team over the course of the season. I believe we were the smartest, most complete baseball team around. Far from dysfunctional, we did all the little things it takes to be great. And nowhere was all of that better demonstrated than in that play-off game against the Red Sox.</p><p>The day before, Sunday, October l, the last day of the regular season, I was thinking about pitching on the next Tuesday in the first game of the play-offs, against Kansas City. We had won six in a row. Boston had won seven in a row. We led them by a game, so all we had to do was win our last game, against Cleveland, or have Boston lose, and we&#x2019;d be in the play-offs. We were rolling, and we were playing against one of the worst teams in the league. But we lost the game 9&#x2013;2. And when Boston beat Toronto 5&#x2013;0, we were tied at ninety-nine wins apiece.</p><p>After we lost, I walked past Bob Lemon in the dugout and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pitch tomorrow.&#x201d; I felt I had earned the right to decide that for myself&#x2014;and the team. I had the most wins in baseball, twenty-four, against only three losses. My earned run average was the lowest in baseball; my nine shutouts, again, the most in baseball. Everyone told me I was a shoo-in to win the American League Cy Young. At that point, if I asked for the ball, I got it.</p><p>The only thing was, typically pitchers get four days of rest between starts. Pitching against Boston had me on three days of rest. And I had thrown my prior two starts on short rest, too. That was both good and bad. I had proven I could handle it. We won both games, and I had thrown a complete game each time. A total of eighteen innings, with six hits and just one run. But consecutive starts on short rest also meant my arm was even more taxed than usual.</p><p>The main thing I needed to think about was how the short rest would affect me. If the good Lord gave me the ability to throw ninety-five miles per hour, I would. At the same time, I knew I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to throw a hundred pitches at ninety-five. Maybe fifty or sixty pitches. That one less day of rest, for a power pitcher, meant a lot. But I knew I could still get people out, even the mighty Red Sox, at ninety-two miles per hour. I just had to be smart about what to throw, and where, and when to dial it up and down.</p><p>The only thing more important than me knowing all of that, though, was that my teammates did. Our catcher and captain, Thurman Munson, never said much to me about it. He spoke up about matters when he needed to and otherwise didn&#x2019;t say squat that didn&#x2019;t need to be said. He didn&#x2019;t have to pat me on the butt and tell me to do this or do that. But he had faith in me, and I had faith in him, and together we knew we could navigate our way through it. And the players behind&nbsp;me on the field knew I wouldn&#x2019;t be throwing as hard as usual&#x2014;so they adjusted their positioning. And as much as anything, those savvy adjustments won us the ball game.</p><p>Pitching in Fenway Park had never bothered me, honestly. Because of the Green Monster&#x2014;the close, towering wall in left field&#x2014;Fenway has a reputation for being tough on left-handed pitchers. But I knew I couldn&#x2019;t change the way I pitch because of the wall. Letting it get into my head, and trying to switch things up from what had been working for me all year, that&#x2019;s what could hurt me. In a one-game play-off, everything is as much mental as it is physical.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t do anything different to prepare because I had no time. By the time we lost on Sunday, and I decided that I&#x2019;d pitch against Boston on Monday, there was nothing to do but get a good night&#x2019;s sleep and try to do what I had done all season. And what I had done during the season first and foremost was to put my mind at rest. In the last month I had pitched against Boston twice. Both games were complete game, two-hit shutouts.</p><p>The first of those two, at Fenway, was part of what would be called &#x201c;the Boston Massacre.&#x201d; Boston was nearly unbeatable at home that season, winning fifty-nine games and losing just twenty-two. Four of those losses came during that series. A four-game sweep of Boston, in Boston. It was unheard-of. You don&#x2019;t do something like that to the Boston Red Sox in their park. I read later that we hadn&#x2019;t swept the Red Sox in Fenway since 1949. We&#x2019;d entered the series trailing them by four games in the division. We left it tied.</p><p>But it wasn&#x2019;t just that we won those four games. It was how we won, and the mental edge that we took from it. We scored forty-two runs in those four games. They put up only nine. They committed twelve errors in those four games. We made only five. We didn&#x2019;t just sweep them. We kicked their behinds. Because of that, we weren&#x2019;t afraid to play them over there, when they won the coin flip for the tiebreaker. It&#x2019;s not that we felt invincible&#x2014;I know I didn&#x2019;t. But we sure had confidence that we could beat them. They were more afraid of us than we were of them. Never in my career had I gone into Boston with the same confidence I had going into that game.</p><p>That wasn&#x2019;t the issue, though. The thing was we just didn&#x2019;t like &#x2019;em. But we had a lot of respect for the Sox, because they had a damn good team. As did we. It was a shame one of us had to lose.</p></p><h2>Cold in the Earth</h2><p>If you&#39;re looking for a gripping new crime series, you&#39;ll love Aline Templeton.

A direct descendant of the Black Death, in London alone it killed more than 100,000 people - perhaps a quarter of the entire population. Its horrors have been etched on our minds by the writings of Daniel Defoe and Samuel Pepys, yet it is hard for us to imagine the sheer scale of the tragedy. Grass grew on deserted main streets while in the poorest quarters the &#39;dead-carts&#39; rolled; men wielding hooked poles scooped hundreds of bodies from houses and gutters, heaping them into plague pits; people disfigured by hideous buboes fell dead in the street or were thrown, dying, over parish boundaries to avoid escalating burial costs; whole families - the living, the dying and the dead - were sealed in their homes for 40 days, at the mercy of rapacious searchers employed to root out victims of the disease. As in most disasters, there were those who behaved with shocking brutality - like the ghoulish cart driver who would take up a dead child by the leg and cry &#34;Faggots - five for sixpence!&#34; Others marked themselves out with enormous courage and compassion. London&#39;s Lord Mayor, Sir John Lawrence, remained at his post when almost all who could afford to had fled the city, and Dr Nathaniel Hodges tended patients throughout the epidemic - never himself catching the plague. Walter Bell&#39;s astonishingly detailed account has never been equalled.

In February 1861, delegates from six states in the Deep South met in Montgomery, Ala., to form their own nation. Despite constant invocations of the spirit of 1776, their movement, in their own view, aimed at reform rather than revolution. Davis (no relation to the Confederate president) traces how the delegates hammered out a constitution that protected slavery, selected Jefferson Davis and Alexander Stephens as provisional president and vice president, and erected the jerry-built governmental apparatus that would turn their dreams of secession into reality. They were a varied lot, from ``fire-eaters'' who expected a swift, comparatively bloodless separation from the Union, to reluctant secessionists who correctly feared a slaughter. By May 1861, when the capital was moved to Richmond, Va., the seeds of the new government's destruction had already been planted. Davis disputes the often-suggested epitaph for the Confederacy, ``Died of States Rights,'' but his own account demonstrates that the correct label might better read, ``Died of States Rights and Swollen Egos.'' However idealistic the delegates might have been initially, by the time they moved to Richmond they were already beginning to regard Jefferson Davis with suspicion, arrogance, and frustrated ambition. Believing that ``the finest statesmen the South had to offer composed that Provisional Congress,'' William Davis is more charitable than the group deserves, and his narrative moves slowly. But he makes fine use of hundreds of often previously unpublished letters, diaries, and memoirs, and he deftly captures the capital's climate as officeholders, office seekers, lobbyists, businessmen, and transients joined the mosquitoes in infesting Montgomery. Despite its flaws, a useful history of a relatively undercovered aspect of the Civil War. (16 pages b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This excellent book is much like Catherine Drinker Bowen's classic <i>Miracle at Philadelphia</i> (1966), which in almost minute-by-minute fashion recounted the proceedings whereby representatives of the 13 newly independent states met to draw up the Constitution, under which our nation is still organized. Davis, a veteran writer on the Civil War period, whose previous book was the well-presented <i>Jefferson Davis</i> (1991), follows the discussions that, in a four-month period in 1861, created a constitution under which the seceded southern states formed a nation-state. The book's greatest asset--in addition to providing an engrossing chronicle of the nation building that went on in Montgomery, Alabama, over the course of those several weeks--is the clarification of the issues surrounding secession and why the endeavor in Montgomery, whose purpose was not to scrap the U.S. Constitution but simply to adapt it to the needs of the southern states, did not succeed in devising a sovereign nation that could last longer than a split second. Handled well here, too, is the way Davis brings back to life and breath the personalities involved, particularly Jefferson Davis, the provisionally appointed and then duly elected chief executive of the Confederacy. A special book for all U.S. history collections. <i>Brad Hooper</i></p><h2>Traveling Light: Poems</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Dark rhyming lyrics about love and impending loss.

The air became filled with specks of black ash and fragments of burning straw floated from the flaming thatch of the cottage. With a crackling roar, Gwyn's home of twelve years was destroyed in as many minutes.</p><p></p><p>The big Cornishman stood impotently in the road outside, watching the destruction in company with his neighbours, who although sympathetic to his loss, were more concerned over the threat to their own roofs by the flying sparks. They had carried leather buckets of turbid water from the well, but there was nothing they could do to save the little building, made of wood-framed wattle plastered with cob -- a mixture of clay, straw and dung.</p><p></p><p>The villagers of St Sidwell, a hamlet just outside Exeter's city walls, had helped Gwyn of Polruan to save what he could of the family's possessions, few that they were, but most of what was in the single-room had gone up in flames. In the plot behind, the hut that his wife Agnes used for her cooking was emptied before it also fell prey to the flying embers -- and their three goats, the fowls and a pair of pigs were also taken to safety in a nearby croft.</p><p></p><p>'How did it start, Gwyn?' asked the man from next door, a mournful fellow who always stank, as he worked in the tannery.</p><p></p><p>'That bloody roof again! A chunk of withies and straw as big as my head fell down into the firepit. By the time the smoke woke me up, it was too late!'</p><p></p><p>The thatch had been laid on woven hazel withies supported by the rafters, always a hazard in dwellings where the fire was in the centre of the floor beneath.</p><p></p><p>'Thank God that Agnes and the boys weren't here,' said the tanner, relishing the drama that was enlivening the humdrum life of the village.</p><p></p><p>'Nothing but damned trouble, this week,' grunted Gwyn. 'Both lads are sickening for something, so she took them down to stay with her sister in Milk Lane. She's good with herbs and potions and suchlike.'</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, the front wall fell in with a crash and fresh streamers of fire spewed up into the night sky.</p><p></p><p>'What's our landlord going to say about losing his house?' asked another neighbour with ill-concealed satisfaction. He rented his own dwelling from the same man, the owner of several fulling-mills on the river, which processed raw wool for the spinners and weavers of the city.</p><p></p><p>'Sod him, the tight-fisted bastard!' growled Gwyn. 'If he won't mend a rotten roof, he has to put up with the consequences.'</p><p></p><p>The tanner nudged him. 'Talk of the devil! Here he is.'</p><p></p><p>The fire made the midnight scene as bright as day and in its glare, they saw a dark-haired man hurrying towards them, his whole demeanour suggesting pent-up anger.</p><p></p><p>'What have you done to my house, you Cornish savage?' he yelled as he came close. 'This is all your fault!'</p><p></p><p>Though Gwyn, like many large men, was normally of a placid nature, this unjust accusation coming so soon after the loss of his home, made him lose his temper.</p><p></p><p>'Don't give me that, Walter Tyrell!' he boomed. 'Your lousy roof collapsed on to my fire. God knows I've asked you often enough to get it mended!'</p><p></p><p>A shouting match soon developed, each man vociferously denying the claims of the other. Surrounded by a circle of neighbours, whose sympathies were totally with Gwyn, the pair squared up to each other, as red-faced as the fire behind them. The two antagonists were as unlike as could be imagined. Gwyn of Polruan was a huge, ginger-haired giant, with long moustaches of the same hue hanging down each side of his chin. Walter Tyrell was of average height, but looked small alongside the coroner's officer. About forty years old, he was coarsely handsome, with dark wavy hair and a rim of black beard around his face. Where Gwyn wore a shabby leather jerkin over his serge breeches, hastily pulled on before he escaped from the burning house, the fuller had a long tunic of blue linen with expensive embroidery around the neck and an ornate belt of embossed leather.</p><p></p><p>'You'll pay for this, you drunken oaf!' yelled Tyrell, his anger fuelled by Gwyn's refusal to defer to what he considered a social superior. 'No doubt you were too full of ale to bank down your fire before you fell unconscious with drink!'</p><p></p><p>This was totally unjust, for though Gwyn was as fond of ale as the next man, he had a prodigious capacity and had never been seen to be obviously drunk. In addition, though he often stayed in Rougemont Castle overnight, drinking and playing dice with his soldier friends, this particular evening he had come home before the city gates closed at curfew, to feed his animals and worry about the sickness that was afflicting his two young sons.</p><p></p><p>'Pay for it?' he snarled at his insolent landlord. 'I've been paying for this pox-ridden slum for a dozen years! At four pence a week, I could have built a mansion in that time!'</p><p></p><p>As the average wage was only two pence a day, this was an appreciable sum, but Tyrell's unreasonable wrath was now in full flow.</p><p></p><p>'You'll pay me five pounds towards the cost of rebuilding -- or I'll take you to the sheriff's court for judgment. And he's a good friend of mine!'</p><p></p><p>Gwyn's blue eyes goggled at the thought of such a huge sum.</p><p></p><p>'You're bloody mad, Tyrell! Where would I get five pounds? And as for your friendship with the sheriff, well, he's a bigger crook than you are!'</p><p></p><p>Incensed at this slur on both his honesty and that of his high-born friend, the fuller made the mistake of punching the Cornishman in the chest. He might as well have struck the city wall, for all the effect it had.</p><p></p><p>Gwyn gave a roar of annoyance and with a hand the size of a ham, pushed Walter in the face, so that he staggered back into the circle of villagers, for whom the prospect of a fight outweighed even a house fire in entertainment value.</p><p></p><p>But now things turned nasty, as sobbing with rage, the swarthy fuller reached to the back of his belt and drew out a wicked-looking dagger. As he brandished this, the crowd fell back, with a communal murmur of disapproval at this unsporting escalation of the quarrel.</p><p></p><p>'Put that away, you silly fool!' growled Gwyn, but Tyrell came forward and lunged at him with the blade. Gwyn stepped back and automatically felt for his sword -- but his hand failed to find the familiar hilt hanging on his belt. He had left it in the cottage and even while confronted by an angry man waving a knife, he fleetingly realized that his most treasured possession was by now probably ruined beyond repair.</p><p></p><p>A dagger attack was no novelty to Gwyn after two decades of fighting across Europe and the Holy Land, but even he was surprised by the ferocity of Tyrell's assault. Dodging the first wild slash, he tried to grab the man's wrist, but the fuller made a back-handed swing which caught Gwyn on the forearm. The sharp blade sliced through the leather of his sleeve and drew blood from a long cut below his elbow. It was not serious, but the Cornishman gave a bellow, more from indignation at being wounded by such an amateur, than from pain.</p><p></p><p>'When I get a sword, I'll cut your bloody head off!' he yelled, to the delight of the circle of onlookers. Deciding that this had gone far enough, Gwyn made a feint with his injured arm and in the split second that Walter's eyes flicked towards it, he gave him a resounding blow on the side of the head with his other fist. As the fuller staggered with his teeth still rattling, Gwyn grabbed his knife arm and twisted the blade from his fingers, then pushed him violently so that he staggered and fell flat on his back on the dusty road.</p><p></p><p>'Clear off, Tyrell! You can have your bloody house back again, what's left of it. I'll rent one further down the street that's got a decent roof!'</p><p></p><p>The red-headed giant threw the knife down alongside Walter, who clambered to his feet, still gibbering with rage, uttering threats and promises of dire retribution.</p><p></p><p>'The sheriff will hear of this first thing in the morning, damn you!' he snarled, as he tried to dust down his soiled tunic. 'You threatened to kill me! I'll attain you for assault at the next Shire Court!'</p><p></p><p>Gwyn, his temper already cooled, grinned at the fuming Walter. 'Will you choose trial by combat, then?' he said mockingly. 'I'll gladly challenge you with dagger or sword!'</p><p></p><p>There were jeers from the circle of spectators and his neighbour joined in the row.</p><p></p><p>'You should sue him, Gwyn! He struck you first -- and he's wounded you!'</p><p></p><p>Landlords being about as popular as tax-collectors, the men of St Sidwell began to scowl and look threateningly at Tyrell, who took the hint and still muttering, loped off towards the East Gate, which though it was well after curfew, had been opened by the porters to let him through because of the nearby fire.</p><p></p><p>With that particular drama over, the men turned their attention back to the burning cottage, but already the collapse of the walls had partly blanketed the fallen thatch and instead of a roaring inferno, the fire was settling into a steady bonfire.</p><p></p><p>'There's nothing you can do until morning, Gwyn,' said the tanner.</p><p></p><p>'Best come home and bed down with us for the rest of the night. My wife can bind up that arm of yours.'</p><p></p><p>As he moved away reluctantly, Gwyn took a last look at the remains of his home.</p><p></p><p>'As soon as it cools, I'll see if I can find my old sword,' he growled. 'But I doubt it'll be much use after being in there!'</p><p></p><p></p><p>'Twenty years I've had this -- and now look at it!'</p><p></p><p>The huge man looked mournfully at the weapon that lay across his knees, as he sat on a stool in the guard-room of Exeter's Rougemont Castle.</p><p></p><p>'I won it in a game of dice in Wexford,' he continued nostalgically. 'It's been with me in campaigns from Ireland to Palestine and saved my life a dozen times!'</p><p></p><p>A thin, leathery old soldier, the sergeant of the garrison's men-at-arms, looked down critically at the sword, as he passed behind the coroner's officer to refill his ale-pot from a jug on a shelf.

Jun Do is <em>The Orphan Master&#x2019;s Son</em>, a North Korean citizen with a rough past who is working as a government-sanctioned kidnapper when we first meet him. He is hardly a sympathetic character, but sympathy is not author Johnson&#x2019;s aim. In a totalitarian nation of random violence and bewildering caprice&#x2014;a poor, gray place that nonetheless refers to itself as &#x201c;the most glorious nation on earth&#x201d;&#x2014;an unnatural tension exists between a citizen&#x2019;s national identity and his private life. Through Jun Do&#x2019;s story we realize that beneath the weight of oppression and lies beats a heart not much different from our own&#x2014;one that thirsts for love, acceptance, and hope&#x2014;and that realization is at the heart of this shockingly believable, immersive, and thrilling novel. <em>--Chris Schluep</em></p> <br><br> <p><b>Adam Johnson on <em>The Orphan Master's Son</em></b></p> <p></p> <p>When I arrived at Pyongyang's Sunan Airport a few years ago, my head was still spinning from a landing on a runway lined with cattle, electric fences and the fuselages of other jets whose landings hadn't gone so well. Even though I'd spent three years writing and researching <em>The Orphan Master's Son</em>, I was unprepared for what I was about to encounter in &#x201c;the most glorious nation in the world.&#x201d;</p> <p>I'd started writing about North Korea because of a fascination with propaganda and the way it prescribes an official narrative to an entire people. In Pyongyang, that narrative begins with the founding of a glorious nation under the fatherly guidance of Kim Il Sung, is followed by years of industry and sacrifice among its citizenry, so that when Kim Jong Il comes to power, all is strength, happiness and prosperity. It didn't matter that the story was a complete fiction--every citizen was forced to become a character whose motivations, desires and fears were dictated by this script. The labor camps were filled with those who hadn't played their parts, who'd spoken of deprivation instead of plenitude and the purest democracy.</p> <p>When I visited places like Pyongyang, Kaesong City, Panmunjom and Myohyangsan, I understood that a genuine interaction with a North Korean citizen was unlikely, since contact with foreigners was illegal. As I walked the streets, not one person would risk a glance, a smile, even a pause in their daily routine. In the Puhung Metro Station, I wondered what happened to personal desires when they came into conflict with a national story. Was it possible to retain a personal identity in such conditions, and under what circumstances would a person reveal his or her true nature? These mysteries--of subsumed selves, of hidden lives, of rewritten longings--are the fuel of novels, and I felt a powerful desire to help reveal what a dynastic dictatorship had forced these people to conceal.</p> <p>Of course, I could only speculate on those lives, filling the voids with research and imagination. Back home, I continued to read books and seek out personal accounts. Testimonies of gulag survivors like Kang Chol Hwan proved invaluable. But I found that most scholarship on the DPRK was dedicated to military, political and economic theory. Fewer were the books that focused directly on the people who daily endured such circumstances. Rarer were the narratives that tallied the personal cost of hidden emotions, abandoned relationships, forgotten identities. These stories I felt a personal duty to tell. Traveling to North Korea filled me with a sense that every person there, from the lowliest laborer to military leaders, had to surrender a rich private life in order to enact one pre-written by the Party. To capture this on the page, I created characters across all levels of society, from the orphan soldier to the Party leaders. And since Kim Jong Il had written the script for all of North Korea, my novel didn't make sense without writing his role as well.</p> <p><b>Featured Photographs</b></p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Anti-tank devices seen while traveling south from Pyongyang toward Panmunj<br> &nbsp;</td> <td>DPRK soldier<br> &nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Air raid sirens<br> &nbsp;</td> <td>Revelutionary Martyr's Cemetery on Mount Taesong</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>Adam Johnson teaches creative writing at Stanford University.

How did a Bavarian immigrant&#x2019;s crockery business expand into one of the nation&#x2019;s top department stores? How did Yiddish theater and humor influence Hollywood and mainstream entertainment? How has Israel affected American Jewish identity? This magnificently illustrated book, companion to the major PBS television documentary produced by David Grubin, tells the history of Jews in America in a captivating and accessible collection of first-person accounts, interviews, distinguished scholarly writings, and profiles of prominent Jews as well as ordinary Jewish immigrants. <br><br>The text and images trace more than three hundred years of American Jewish history&#x2014; from the first arrival of Jews in colonial America in 1654 to the social movements of today&#x2014;and everything in between. The book chronicles the mass immigration of Jews in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the innovations of American Jewish culture, responses to anti-Semitism, and transition from immigrant to middle-class neighborhoods. It tells the story of the Jewish presence in sports and entertainment, the transformative watershed events of World War II and the Holocaust, the impact of the establishment of Israel, the emergence of new forms of American Jewish identity, and the responsibilities of the Jewish community today.<br><br>This comprehensive and often surprising look at the growth, difficulties, and accomplishments of the Jewish American community is further enhanced by the intimate first-person accounts of several generations of American Jews. Activists, musicians, spiritual leaders, politicians, and so many others come to life through their photos, correspondence, and interviews. They lend faces and personal experiences to the movements and events they lived through, and they remind us that the story of Jews is the story of America. Carving out a life for themselves in the free and open society of the United States, Jews maintained their identity while becoming an integral part of American culture.</p></p><p><p>In addition to authoring <i>The Jewish Americans</i>, Beth S.

Coming from European countries where the Jewish community regulated virtually all aspects of religious, social, and economic life, these Jews and those who followed in subsequent years encountered an unprecedented challenge that would characterize the first two centuries of Jewish life in America: How would Jews build a community and culture from the ground up? Even more daunting, how would that Jewish community function when it had virtually no restrictions imposed upon it by the government&#x2014;and where individual Jews and Jewish institutions had, for the first time, complete freedom to shape Jewish life on their own terms? The encounter with freedom defined the course of American Jewish history and resulted in the most unique, innovative, and diverse culture that Jews had ever known. <br><br>The twenty-three Jews who initiated the opening chapter of Jewish history in the colonies hardly had freedom granted to them immediately. These Jews had fled the island of Recife when the Portuguese seized it from the Dutch. They took refuge aboard the <i>Sainte Catherine</i>, which happened to be sailing for New Amsterdam. Governor Peter Stuyvesant, who ruled the Dutch&#x2013;owned colony, wanted to refuse them admission and requested that his superiors in Holland prohibit Jews from settling in New Amsterdam. Stuyvesant insisted that &#x201c;the deceitful race,&#x201d; &#x201c;the hateful enemies and blasphemers of the name of Christ&#x201d; would only bring harm the new colony. (1) But the Jewish settlers contacted fellow Jews in Amsterdam, who successfully petitioned the Dutch West India Company to overrule Stuyvesant&#x2019;s pleas.<br><br>Because Jews had been loyal and economically productive residents of Holland, the Dutch believed they could be the same in the fledgling colony and ruled that Jews would be welcome to live and work in New Amsterdam. This did not mean that Jews received immediate equality or freedom in the New World; they encountered a number of restrictions on their economic and religious activity as well as limitations on office&#x2013;holding and public service. Over the years, they petitioned and gradually won most rights of trade and commerce. They were allowed to construct a Jewish cemetery not long after arriving&#x2014;a pressing need for any new Jewish community and usually the first collective act taken by Jews in each new settlement in colonial America. Jews received the right to worship in private homes relatively quickly, but it took almost thirty years for the community to receive permission to worship publicly, even after the British took over the colony in 1664 and renamed it New York. Jews were not the only group to face such restrictions in colonial America; in fact, many Christian denominations encountered even greater limitations on the practice of their religion, depending on which established church was in control at a given time. There remained many legal obstacles to overcome, but Jews proved willing to press for greater rights, constantly petitioning individual cases and in most cases succeeding in their efforts.<br><br>Despite lingering disabilities, Jews lived securely and relatively freely in the New World. There were so few Jews in the colonies that they generally attracted little attention. At the time of the American Revolution, more than a century after the first Jews arrived in New Amsterdam,<br>the Jewish population likely numbered about 2,000 out of a general population of roughly 2.5 million. To lend greater perspective, approximately 242 Jews resided in New York in 1773, constituting the largest Jewish population center at the time. (2) The Sephardim, or Iberian Jews, were the first to settle in the colonies and they remained the elites for more than two generations. All the colonial synagogues practiced Sephardic rite, despite the fact that by 1720, Ashkenazim, Jews from Central and Eastern Europe, made up the majority of the Jewish population, as they would for the duration of American Jewish history.<br><br>The first Jews settled largely in port cities along the East Coast in colonies, and later states, with the most liberal policies of toleration. In the young, developing frontier of early America, Jews constructed new lives in an unprecedented environment, in a country with no legacy of a medieval past and comparatively few restrictions on their individual and communal rights. Those who ventured to this untested terrain spent their first years in America preoccupied with making a living and establishing the rudiments of a Jewish community. <br><br>The tiny Jewish settlements of the nascent United States functioned as satellites of the larger, more established Jewish communities in England and Holland. The Atlantic Jewish world of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries consisted of interconnected, interdependent Jewish communities throughout the New World, with London and Amsterdam as the anchors. For more than a century, early America was simply one of many outposts, along with Jamaica,<br>Barbados, Suriname, and Cura�ao; in fact, the American colonies began as the smallest and least developed of the newly emerging communities. Economic ties linked Jewish communities and Jewish families across the ocean and throughout the New World. Indeed, the colonial Jewish economy could be described using family names, such as Lopez, Seixas, Gomez, and Hendricks, whose family connections crossed both sides of the Atlantic Ocean and extended up and down the East Coast, fortified by marriages, sibling cooperation, and intricate family ties. Ocean commerce created the nexus of the Jewish economy. Shipping records from the period reveal that Jews depended on trade and cooperation with one another. They traded sugar, furniture, candles, horses, all sorts of meat and fish, barley, rice, and a host of other goods. Some colonial Jews did transport slaves to the New World, though it was hardly a dominant area of trade. While most inhabitants of early America engaged in agrarian pursuits, Jews gravitated toward commerce and used their international connections to build the emerging economy. The unprecedented level of tolerance that Jews found in the New World owed largely to their economic contributions. As one historian has explained, &#x201c;trade made the colonies and Jews made trade.&#x201d; (3)<br><br>Religious observance could be a challenge in early America. By all accounts, many Jews exhibited a certain laxity in keeping the Sabbath and following the Jewish dietary laws (<i>kashrut</i>), especially outside their own homes. At the same time, a concerted effort to maintain Jewish practice also existed among the first Jewish generations in America. Life in the New World offered some the first opportunity to live openly as Jews. Aaron Lopez, one of the most successful merchants in Newport, had been born a Catholic to a family living under the Portuguese Inquisition, but once in the colonies reclaimed his Judaism, submitted to circumcision as an adult, and faithfully practiced Judaism throughout his life. (4) The value placed on Jewish observance can be seen in the number of Jews who journeyed across the ocean with cherished ritual objects, such as Shabbat candles and Kiddush cups. In virtually every sizeable community, Jews built a <i>mikveh</i> (ritual bath), established the means to obtain kosher meat through a <i>shochet</i> (ritual slaughterer), and created synagogues as soon as they had the legal and financial ability to do so.<br><br>Observing Jewish law was easier in the larger Jewish communities than in the outlying areas of early America. Writing to her parents in Germany in the early 1700s, Rebecca Samuel lamented the lack of Jewish practice in the small town of Petersburg, Virginia, where she lived. She complained that local Jews kept their businesses open on Saturdays and worshipped without even a Torah scroll on Rosh Hashanah. &#x201c;Jewishness is pushed aside here...I crave to see a synagogue to which I can go,&#x201d; Samuel reported, informing her parents that she and her family would soon relocate to the larger Jewish community of Charleston, South Carolina. (5) <br><br>In the first century after Jewish arrival, congregations sprang up in the port cities of New York, Newport, Savannah, Philadelphia, and Charleston. When they raised sufficient funds to construct houses of worship, the Jews of these communities built synagogues in the architectural styles of the times; they reflected traditional Jewish custom and design on the inside but contained no outward signs to mark the buildings as Jewish congregations, blending unobtrusively into the American environment. Just as they did in the arena of commerce, Jews relied on mutual support to create and sustain the first synagogues. In 1759, when the Jews of Newport set out to build a synagogue, they turned to the more established congregation in New York &#x201c;for charitable assistance towards carrying on this work,&#x201d; and the Jewish New Yorkers complied. Some thirty years earlier, Jews from London, Jamaica, Cura�ao and Barbados had done the same for New York when it built its first synagogue. (6) Within the Atlantic world, Torah scrolls, religious ornaments, and other necessities were regularly donated and exchanged to fortify fledgling Jewish communities.<br><br>No rabbis lived or worked regularly in the United States until 1840, so for almost 200 years, congregations relied entirely on lay leadership. If they had questions about Jewish law, Jews sent them to rabbinic authorities in Europe. Throughout the eighteenth century, synagogues remained the central Jewish institutions in America, and with only one in each community, they operated as monopolies. Synagogues controlled the Jewish cemetery, paid the shochet who provided kosher meat, offered rudimentary Jewish education to children, and supervised every Jewish life cycle event from the cradle to the grave....</p><h2>She&#39;s Turning into One of Them!

Anderson is at C.U.N.Y. Brooklyn College. Judith P. Zinsser is at Miami University.Organized around the thesis that "gender has been the most important factor in shaping the lives of European women," this sweeping history describes women's experience in terms of social groups and work, with chronology secondary. The approach, which revealed interesting themes in volume 1 ( LJ 5/1/88), is inadequate for the rapid changes of the 19th and 20th centuries. More minor flaws mar this volume. The section on prostitution flows directly into that dealing with performing arts, perpetuating an unfortunate old association. Women's struggles to organize trade unions are greatly oversimplified. Only partially successful.

This new book documents that explosion in Russia, unveiling canvases that resonate with the pure color, sparkling light, and lively depictions of everyday life that characterize Impressionism at its best. <p>Chosen from the holdings of the State Russian Museum in St. Petersburg, the works displayed in this handsome volume focus on a chapter in Russia's rich cultural history that has been too long overlooked. Now, the broad range of Russian Impressionism is made abundantly clear in 340 lush colorplates and in illuminating essays. The superb paintings, most rarely or never published before, make this collection an essential addition to any art lover's library. </p><p>VLADIMIR KRUGLOV, an art historian and leading curator at the State Russian Museum, has published extensively on the history of Russian art. </p><p>VLADIMIR LENYASHIN is currently head of the late 19th- and early 20th-century painting department at the State Russian Museum and is a professor at the Ilya Repin Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture in St. Petersburg. </p><p>340 illustrations in full color, 81/2 x 14"</p></p><p>Impressionism flourished in Russia from its inception and for decades after, but who knew? As art historian and State Russian Museum curator Kruglov writes, Russian impressionist painting is "an unknown and underrated phenomena." This groundbreaking volume, which contains 340 glowing illustrations of work by 140 artists (all concisely profiled), puts an end to this neglect and presents the legions of art lovers who possess a seemingly insatiable appetite for impressionistic works with a whole new universe to explore. Both Kruglov and his colleague, Lenyashin, offer enlightening historical overviews that compare and contrast these diverse Russian painters with each other and with their European and American counterparts, and chronicle their struggles for recognition. The paintings themselves are fascinating. Russian painters tended to wield a heavier hand and use a darker palette than other impressionists, and, although their subject matter is similar, the ambiance and details are distinctly Russian, thus revealing a world long hidden from outsiders. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Tour.</p><p>Piles of money, international power plays, cutthroat business tactics, unique personalities, and the politics of social class--that should be enough for a really juicy read, don't you think? But why stop there when you can also have smuggling, Swiss bank accounts, espionage, royal families, and mansions on the Riviera? Did anyone mention art? This riveting history of Sotheby's, the world's richest auction house, has that too, of course, but mainly as a lifestyle accessory. <p> With impeccable style, a deft touch with the telling detail, and an elegant way of delivering gossip with the proper journalistic distance, Robert Lacey has plotted a company history that reads like a thriller. There are unbusinesslike gems on nearly every page: "The tasty young ladies of 'Client Advisory' [a new Sotheby's department] were the next step in the process--the conversion of the rich and curious into solid bidders and buyers." Business and pleasure sometimes mingle: "Puzzled as to why the accounts department, which incurred regular bills for weekend overtime, was taking so long to produce figures, [the new corporate manager] asked John Cann, the director of administration, to investigate. 'They are having orgies,' Cann reported. 'They are coming in on Sundays and having sex.'"</p><p> But such stories are just the baubles on Lacey's minutely detailed history of Sotheby's rise from its humble origins in the rare-books trade of 1744 to the public company of today. Lacey is good on the art part, which, although essential to the story, is also somewhat ephemeral. He provides thoughtful cameos of the eccentric connoisseurs of old masters, Italian glass, Georgian silver, or Oriental furniture whose brilliance and sensitivity gave the auction business its special cachet. Of the highborn Peter Wilson, Sotheby's longtime chairman and a legend in every corner of the art world, for example, Lacey writes: "He would roll a carved ivory netsuke worth a few pounds between his fingers with the same delight with which he greeted an old master worth tens of thousands, for the secret of PCW's eye was his ability to be genuinely interested in almost anything." In Lacey's capable hands, the reader finds every facet of this story equally spellbinding. <i>--Margaret Moorman</i></p>If the world's oldest auction house is still reeling from the art smuggling sting in Peter Watson's Sotheby's: The Inside Story (1997), it won't enjoy Lacey's gossipy, page-turning history. Lacey, author of books on Grace Kelly (Grace, 1994) Henry Ford's automotive empire (Ford: The Man and the Machine, 1986), and Meyer Lansky's gangster life (Little Man, 1991), is triply equipped to deal with Sotheby's colorful directors and employees, its schemes to get the highest prices (whether for van Gogh's Irises or Jackie O's costume jewelry), and its sharp, sometimes dubious business practices in pursuing its ruthless rivalry with Christie's. While Sotheby's origins go back to Samuel Baker, a bookseller who opened his business in 1733, credit for originating modern auctioneeringparticularly for cultivating the intangible value of ``taste'' and profiting from itgoes to James Christie, who began in 1766. The two houses coexisted peacefully until a change in Sotheby's ownership in 1908 introduced real competition, and here Lacey's account takes off into something like Evelyn Waugh's Vile Bodies crossed with Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities. Sotheby's new owners quickly changed it from a collegial, somewhat pokey enterprise into a suave, cosmopolitan clearinghouse for Old Masters and objets d'art. The real force behind Sotheby's modern transformation, and its shifting into ethical gray areas, was Peter Wilson, who joined in 1936. The mercurial Wilson, ambitious and irresistibly charming, won over the wealthy as clients and customers during the postwar art boom and established Sotheby's in America with the takeover of Parke-Bernet, New York City's premier auction house. Wilson also not only turned a blind eye to objects of questionable provenance, but even engaged in rules-bending directly, with the sale of the Sevso Roman silver for which three countries claimed ownership. As smooth, beguiling, and speedy as any auctioneer's patter, Lacey's account mounts in excitement, ending in Sotheby's successful sale of a slice of the duke and duchess of Windsor's wedding cake.

To begin with, Giovanni is ten years younger than I am, and, like most Italian guys in their twenties, he still lives with his mother. These facts alone make him an unlikely romantic partner for me, given that I am a professional American woman in my mid-thirties, who has just come through a failed marriage and a devastating, interminable divorce, followed immediately by a passionate love affair that ended in sickening heartbreak. This loss upon loss has left me feeling sad and brittle and about seven thousand years old. Purely as a matter of principle I wouldn't inflict my sorry, busted-up old self on the lovely, unsullied Giovanni. Not to mention that I have finally arrived at that age where a woman starts to question whether the wisest way to get over the loss of one beautiful brown-eyed young man is indeed to promptly invite another one into her bed. This is why I have been alone for many months now. This is why, in fact, I have decided to spend this entire year in celibacy.</p><p>To which the savvy observer might inquire: 'Then why did you come to <i>Italy</i>?'</p><p>To which I can only reply&#x2014;especially when looking across the table at handsome Giovanni&#x2014; 'Excellent question.'</p><p>Giovanni is my Tandem Exchange Partner. That sounds like an innuendo, but unfortunately it's not. All it really means is that we meet a few evenings a week here in Rome to practice each other's languages. We speak first in Italian, and he is patient with me; then we speak in English, and I am patient with him. I discovered Giovanni a few weeks after I'd arrived in Rome, thanks to that big Internet caf� at the Piazza Barbarini, across the street from that fountain with the sculpture of that sexy merman blowing into his conch shell. He (Giovanni, that is&#x2014;not the merman) had posted a flier on the bulletin board explaining that a native Italian speaker was seeking a native English speaker for conversational language practice. Right beside his appeal was another flier with the same request, word-for-word identical in every way, right down to the typeface. The only difference was the contact information. One flier listed an e-mail address for somebody named Giovanni; the other introduced somebody named Dario. But even the home phone number was the same.</p><p>Using my keen intuitive powers, I e-mailed both men at the same time, asking in Italian, "Are you perhaps brothers?"</p><p>It was Giovanni who wrote back this very <i>provocativo</i> message: "Even better. Twins!"</p><p>Yes&#x2014;much better. Tall, dark and handsome identical twenty-five-year-old twins, as it turned out, with those giant brown liquid-center Italian eyes that just unstitch me. After meeting the boys in person, I began to wonder if perhaps I should adjust my rule somewhat about remaining celibate this year. For instance, perhaps I could remain totally celibate <i>except</i> for keeping a pair of handsome twenty-five-year-old Italian twin brothers as lovers. Which was slightly reminiscent of a friend of mine who is vegetarian except for bacon, but nonetheless ... I was already composing my letter to <i>Penthouse</i>:</p><p><i>In the flickering, candlelit shadows of the Roman caf�, it was impossible to tell whose hands were caress</i>&#x2014;</p><p>But, no.</p><p>No and no.</p><p>I chopped tvhe fantasy off in mid-word. This was not my moment to be seeking romance and (as day follows night) to further complicate my already knotty life. This was my moment to look for the kind of healing and peace that can only come from solitude.</p><p>Anyway, by now, by the middle of November, the shy, studious Giovanni and I have become dear buddies. As for Dario&#x2014;the more razzle-dazzle swinger brother of the two&#x2014;I have introduced him to my adorable little Swedish friend Sofie, and how they've been sharing <i>their</i> evenings in Rome is another kind of Tandem Exchange altogether. But Giovanni and I, we only talk. Well, we eat and we talk. We have been eating and talking for many pleasant weeks now, sharing pizzas and gentle grammatical corrections, and tonight has been no exception. A lovely evening of new idioms and fresh mozzarella.</p><p>Now it is midnight and foggy, and Giovanni is walking me home to my apartment through these back streets of Rome, which meander organically around the ancient buildings like bayou streams snaking around shadowy clumps of cypress groves. Now we are at my door. We face each other. He gives me a warm hug. This is an improvement; for the first few weeks, he would only shake my hand. I think if I were to stay in Italy for another three years, he might actually get up the juice to kiss me. On the other hand, he might just kiss me right now, tonight, right here by my door ... there's still a chance ... I mean we're pressed up against each other's bodies beneath this moonlight ... and of course it would be a <i>terrible</i> mistake ... but it's still such a wonderful possibility that he might actually do it right now ... that he might just bend down ... and ... and ... Nope.</p><p>He separates himself from the embrace.</p><p>"Good night, my dear Liz," he says.</p><p>"<i>Buona notte, caro mio</i>," I reply.</p><p>I walk up the stairs to my fourth-floor apartment, all alone. I let myself into my tiny little studio, all alone. I shut the door behind me. Another solitary bedtime in Rome. Another long night's sleep ahead of me, with nobody and nothing in my bed except a pile of Italian phrasebooks and dictionaries.</p><p>I am alone, I am all alone, I am completely alone.</p><p>Grasping this reality, I let go of my bag, drop to my knees and press my forehead against the floor. There, I offer up to the universe a fervent prayer of thanks.</p><p>First in English.</p><p>Then in Italian.</p><p>And then&#x2014;just to get the point across&#x2014;in Sanskrit.<br><br><b>2</b><br><br>And since I am already down there in supplication on the floor, let me hold that position as I reach back in time three years earlier to the moment when this entire story began&#x2014;a moment which also found me in this exact same posture: on my knees, on a floor, praying.</p><p>Everything else about the three-years-ago scene was different, though. That time, I was not in Rome but in the upstairs bathroom of the big house in the suburbs of New York which I'd recently purchased with my husband. It was a cold November, around three o'clock in the morning. My husband was sleeping in our bed. I was hiding in the bathroom for something like the forty-seventh consecutive night, and&#x2014;just as during all those nights before&#x2014;I was sobbing. Sobbing so hard, in fact, that a great lake of tears and snot was spreading before me on the bathroom tiles, a veritable Lake Inferior (if you will) of all my shame and fear and confusion and grief.</p><p><i>I don't want to be married anymore</i>.</p><p>I was trying so hard not to know this, but the truth kept insisting itself to me.</p><p><i>I don't want to be married anymore. I don't want to live in this big house. I don't want to have a baby</i>.</p><p>But I was supposed to want to have a baby. I was thirty-one years old. My husband and I&#x2014;who had been together for eight years, married for six&#x2014;had built our entire life around the common expectation that, after passing the doddering old age of thirty, I would want to settle down and have children. By then, we mutually anticipated, I would have grown weary of traveling and would be happy to live in a big, busy household full of children and homemade quilts, with a garden in the backyard and a cozy stew bubbling on the stovetop. (The fact that this was a fairly accurate portrait of my own mother is a quick indicator of how difficult it once was for me to tell the difference between myself and the powerful woman who had raised me.) But I didn't&#x2014;as I was appalled to be finding out&#x2014;want any of these things. Instead, as my twenties had come to a close, that deadline of THIRTY had loomed over me like a death sentence, and I discovered that I did not want to be pregnant. I kept waiting to want to have a baby, but it didnt happen. And I know what it feels like to want something, believe me. I well know what desire feels like. But it wasn't there. Moreover, I couldn't stop thinking about what my sister had said to me once, as she was breast-feeding her firstborn: 'Having a baby is like getting a tattoo on your face. You really need to be certain it's what you want before you commit.'</p><p>How could I turn back now, though? Everything was in place. This was supposed to be the year. In fact, we'd been trying to get pregnant for a few months already. But nothing had happened (aside from the fact that&#x2014;in an almost sarcastic mockery of pregnancy&#x2014;I was experiencing psychosomatic morning sickness, nervously throwing up my breakfast every day). And every month when I got my period I would find myself whispering furtively in the bathroom: <i>Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you for giving me one more month to live</i> ... </p><p> </p><p></p></p><h2>Cuba TV: Dos Canales</h2><p>The TV sets themselves are outdated, pre-revolution relics imported from America or sets from Russia over twenty years old; green-hued beasts jimmy-rigged with ancient parts and fantastically adorned like religious altars.

It was pitch black except for the faint colorful glow spilling out of open doors everywhere, and it came from the TVs. The light captivated me. For the next two weeks I wandered around, slipping in and out of strangers&#39; living rooms. Each time I came across an open door and a working TV set, I would ask if I could take a picture. The answer was always yes. Nobody seemed to think it was an odd request and it was usually accompanied by a Cuban coffee or rum.Simone Lueck (b. St. Paul) lives and works in Los Angeles, CA.

Readers of Christopher Andersen&#x2019;s <em>Jackie After Jack </em>and Pamela Clarke Keogh&#x2019;s <em>Jackie Style </em>will find no better look at the intimate world of America&#x2019;s Queen of Camelot than Tina Cassidy&#x2019;s <em>Jackie After O</em>.<br></p><p><p>Defined in the public eye by her two high-profile marriages, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis faced a personal crossroads on the eve of 1975. Her relationship with Aristotle Onassis was crumbling while his health was rapidly declining. Her children were nearing adulthood, soon to leave her with an empty nest. Both death and scandal were about to strike yet again. But 1975 would also be a time of incredible growth and personal renaissance for Jackie, the year in which she reinvented herself and rediscovered talents and passions she had set aside for her roles as wife and mother.</p> <p>In <em>Jackie After O</em>, acclaimed author and journalist Tina Cassidy explores this prolific yet incredibly daunting year in the life of Jacqueline Onassis, including her part in the campaign to preserve Grand Central Terminal in New York City; her pursuit of a real career, in the editorial department of Viking Press; the death of her second husband and her fraught relationship with his surviving daughter; and the London bombing that almost took her own daughter's life. Cassidy has unearthed new information from archives and original interviews, and reveals intimate stories about the projects and interests of Jackie's earlier years that would lay the foundation for her life beginning in 1975, from an internship at <em>Vogue</em> to her meticulous restoration of the White House when she was First Lady.</p> <p><em>Jackie After O</em> is an exciting and original portrayal of the life of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis through the lens of one remarkable year, a time of reinvention both personal and public, as she shook the world's expectations and pursued her dreams in middle age.</p><p>Tina Cassidy, an acclaimed author and journalist, spent most of her career as a reporter and editor at the <em>Boston Globe</em>, where she covered a variety of topics, including business, politics, and fashion.

The truth is that unseen forces such as telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, psychokinesis, psychic healing, and other phenomena inextricably link us to the spiritual world, and while many skeptics and scientists deny the existence of these spiritual phenomena, the experiences of millions of people indicate that they do take place.</p><p>In this book, copublished with the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS), transpersonal psychologist Charles Tart presents over fifty years of scientific research conducted at the nation's leading universities that proves humans do have natural spiritual impulses and abilities. <b>The End of Materialism</b> presents an elegant argument for the union of science and spirituality in light of this new evidence, and explains why a truly rational viewpoint must address the reality of a spiritual world.

In the idyllic English countryside, Mole, Badger, Rat and Toad encounter adventure at every turn -- whether it&#39;s gipsy caravans, Rat&#39;s love for the river, or Toads passion for motorcars, the loveable friends and their escapades continue to delight children and adults alike.</p><p>"[Mole] thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in his life had he seen a river before--this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again." Such is the cautious, agreeable Mole's first introduction to the river and the Life Adventurous. Emerging from his home at Mole End one spring, his whole world changes when he hooks up with the good-natured, boat-loving Water Rat, the boastful Toad of Toad Hall, the society- hating Badger who lives in the frightening Wild Wood, and countless other mostly well-meaning creatures. Michael Hague's exquisitely detailed, breathtaking color illustrations on almost every generous spread--along with Kenneth Grahame's elegant, delightfully old-fashioned characterizations of the animals--make this book a wonderful read-aloud.

Reprint.</p><p>Tomi Ungerer, illustrator of Jeff Brown's original <i>Flat Stanley</i> and winner of the prestigious 1998 Hans Christian Andersen Illustrator Award, paints the man in the moon as a benevolent, soft-bodied man who curls up in "his shimmering seat in space." Most evenings, he looks over longingly at the happy, dancing earth people, until one night when he can't resist catching the fiery tail of a comet and hitching a ride to Earth. Ungerer, ever satirical, reports the resulting frenzy of authorities upon hearing the crash landing: "The noise brought hundreds of people from a nearby town. Soldiers sped to defend the earth. Firemen hastened to quench the flaming light. The ice cream man hurried to set up his stand for the spectators." Of course, when the crowd discovers the unidentified fallen object, "statesmen, scientists, and generals panicked." Moon Man is thrown in jail, facing criminal investigation! How will he ever return to his lunar dwelling? Kids will love this quirky "there's no place like home" tale, and Ungerer's gentle, funny mocking of "important people" won't be lost on anyone.

So Tipler embarked on just such a scientific inquiry. <i>The Physics of Christianity </i>presents the fascinating results of his pioneering study.<br><br>Tipler begins by outlining the basic concepts of physics for the lay reader and brings to light the underlying connections between physics and theology. In a compelling example, he illustrates how the God depicted by Jews and Christians, the Uncaused First Cause, is completely consistent with the Cosmological Singularity, an entity whose existence is required by physical law. His discussion of the scientific possibility of miracles provides an impressive, credible scientific foundation for many of Christianity&#x2019;s most astonishing claims, including the Virgin Birth, the Resurrection, and the Incarnation. He even includes specific outlines for practical experiments that can help prove the validity of the &#x201c;miracles&#x201d; at the heart of Christianity.<br><br>Tipler&#x2019;s thoroughly rational approach and fully accessible style sets <i>The Physics of Christianity</i> apart from other books dealing with conflicts between science and religion. It will appeal not only to Christian readers, but also to anyone interested in an issue that triggers heated and divisive intellectual and cultural debates.</p></p><p><p>FRANK J. TIPLER is a professor of mathematical physics at Tulane University and the author of <i>The Physics of Immortality</i>. He lives in New Orleans, Louisiana.</p><b>I<br>Introduction: Christianity as Physics<br></b><br><br>The latest observations of the cosmic background radiation show that the universe began 13.7 billion years ago at the Singularity. Stephen Hawking proved mathematically that the Singularity is not in time or in space, but outside both. In other words, the Singularity is transcendent to space and time. According to the theologian Thomas Aquinas, &#x201c;God created the Universe&#x201d; means simply that all causal chains begin in God. God is the Uncaused Cause. In physics, all causal chains begin in the Singularity. The Singularity itself has no cause. For a thousand years and more, Christian theologians have asserted that there is one and only one &#x201c;achieved&#x201d; (actually existing) infinity, and that infinity is God. The Cosmological Singularity is an achieved infinity.<br><br>The Cosmological Singularity is God.<br><br>&#x201c;But,&#x201d; the average person may protest, &#x201c;the &#x2018;Cosmological Singularity&#x2019; is not my idea of God. I picture God as a kindly, white&#x2013;haired old man, loving but with immense power. The &#x2018;Cosmological Singularity&#x2019; (whatever that is) is too abstract, too intellectual to be <i>my</i> God, the God I pray to every night. It sounds like some crazy idea some physicist would dream up. It&#x2019;s definitely not the God of Judaism or Christianity.&#x201d;<br><br>Not so. The Cosmological Singularity is the Judeo&#x2013;Christian God. Think of it this way. Everybody knows that when you flip a light switch, the light goes on because an electrical current flows in the wires in the walls. Everybody also knows that electrons carry the electric charge whose motion makes the electric current. I invite you to imagine an &#x201c;electron&#x201d;&#x2014;you must have <i>some</i> image of an electron, since you use the word.<br><br>Now let me ask you: when you imagined an &#x201c;electron,&#x201d; did you imagine an excitation of a quantized, relativistic fermion field, part of an electroweak doublet? Unless you are a professional physicist, I know you didn&#x2019;t. You probably imagined a little ball of some sort. Such an image is good for some purposes, even in physics. One can compute a fairly accurate value for the &#x201c;drift velocity&#x201d; of the electrons through the wire using the &#x201c;little ball&#x201d; image of the electron. But did you know that the electrons which carry the current in the wire are at a temperature of 80,000 degrees Celsius (140,000 degrees Fahrenheit)? (1) You might wonder, If the conduction electrons are at that high a temperature, why don't they melt the wires? Why don't they start a fire and burn the house down? The reason is that the conduction electrons can't give up their high&#x2013;temperature energy to the wires. But to understand why the electrons can&#x2019;t give up their energy, one has to go beyond the &#x201c;little ball&#x201d; image of the electron. (One has to think &#x201c;quantized fermion.&#x201d;)<br><br>Similarly, everyone has an image of &#x201c;God,&#x201d; but to really understand what God really is and how He could interact with the universe, one must use a theory beyond everyday commonsense physics. Contrary to what many physicists have claimed in the popular press, we have had a Theory of Everything for about thirty years. Most physicists dislike this Theory of Everything because it requires the universe to begin in a singularity. That is, they dislike it because the theory is consistent only if God exists, and most contemporary scientists are atheists. They don&#x2019;t want God to exist, and if keeping God out of science requires rejecting physical laws, well, so be it.<br><br>My approach to reality is different. I believe that we have to accept the implications of physical law, whatever these implications are. If they imply the existence of God, well then, God exists.<br><br>We can also use the physical laws to tell us what the Cosmological Singularity&#x2014;God&#x2014;is like. The laws of physics tell us that our universe began in an initial singularity, and it will end in a final singularity. The laws also tell us that ours is but one of an infinite number of universes, all of which begin and end in a singularity. If we look carefully at the collection of all the universes&#x2014;this collection is called the <i>multiverse</i>&#x2014;we see that there is a third singularity, at which the multiverse began. But physics shows us that these three apparently distinct singularities are actually one singularity. The Three are One.<br><br>There is one religion which claims that God is a Trinity: Christianity. According to Christianity, God consists of Three Persons: God the Father (the First Person), God the Son (the Second Person), and God the Holy Ghost (the Third Person). But there are not three Gods, only one God. Using physics to study the structure of the Cosmological Singularity, we can see that indeed the three &#x201c;parts&#x201d; of the Singularity can be distinguished by employing the idea of personhood. In particular, physics can be used to show how it is possible for a man&#x2014;Jesus, according to Christianity&#x2014;to actually <i>be</i> the part of the Singularity that connects the Initial and Final Singularities. So the Incarnation makes perfectly good sense from the point of view of physics.<br><br>Traditional Christianity has always claimed that &#x201c;miracles&#x201d; do not violate ultimate physical law, although a miracle may violate our limited knowledge of physical law. Thus, if we know ultimate physical law&#x2014;and if our Theory of Everything is correct, we do&#x2014;we should be able to explain all the miracles of Christianity.<br><br>And so we can. The miracle of the Star of Bethlehem was a supernova in the Andromeda Galaxy. The miracle of the Virgin Birth of Jesus, the virgin birth of a male, is plausible if we use modern knowledge of exactly how DNA codes for gender. One expects that, in a virgin birth, all the DNA in the child would come from the mother alone. This is possible if Jesus were an XX male. In the U.S. population, 1 male in 20,000 is an XX male. Using modern DNA technology, it is a simple matter to test whether a male is an XX male. A DNA test was performed on the Shroud of Turin, claimed to be the burial shroud of Jesus, and the Oviedo Cloth, claimed to be the &#x201c;napkin&#x201d; that covered Jesus&#x2019; face in his tomb. The DNA on both relics is just what one would expect if it were the DNA of an XX male.<br><br>According to Christians, Jesus rose from the dead in a &#x201c;resurrection body,&#x201d; a body that we will all have at the Universal Resurrection in the future. This &#x201c;Glorified Body&#x201d; was capable of &#x201c;dematerializing&#x201d; at one location and &#x201c;materializing&#x201d; in another. Modern particle physics provides a mechanism for dematerialization: conversion of the matter of an object into neutrinos, which are elementary particles that interact very weakly with normal matter and thus would be invisible. Reversing the process would result in apparently materializing out of nothing. If this was the mechanism of Jesus&#x2019; Resurrection, there are several tests that could demonstrate it. In fact, some of these tests are so simple that an ordinary person could carry them out. The image of Jesus on the Turin Shroud has certain features we would expect to arise in the neutrino dematerialization process.<br><br>Christians claim that Jesus will come again, at the end of human history. Two developments in physics suggest that human history will end in about fifty years: computer experts predict that computers will exceed human intelligence within fifty years, and the dematerialization mechanism can be used to make weapons that are to atomic bombs as atomic bombs are to spitballs. Such weapons and superhuman computers would make human survival unlikely, and in his discussion of the Second Coming, Jesus said he would return when humans faced a &#x201c;Great Tribulation&#x201d; of such magnitude that we would not survive without his direct intervention. We will face such a Great Tribulation within fifty years.<br><br>From the perspective of the latest physical theories, Christianity is not a mere religion but an experimentally testable science.<br><b>II<br>A Brief Outline of Modern Physics<br></b><br><br>The Many&#x2013;Worlds Interpretation is trivially true. &#x2014; Stephen W.

The editors refer to Dr Tim Keller as one of the most influential evangelical leaders of our time and we gladly acknowledge that Keller intends to teach the orthodox truth. They say that they have entered into debate with Keller because he is a good man who is so widely admired that he has merited the sustained attention of our contributors. Indeed, Keller has consistently demonstrated his commitment to Reformed orthodoxy in numerous ways. He is ordained in the Presbyterian Church in America. He chooses to serve at seminaries such as Westminster Theological Seminary which are explicitly committed to confessional standards. These things all indicate to us that Keller is orthodox in his beliefs. So the ground rules are clearly laid out. Dr Keller is a sound, Presbyterian minister who teaches orthodox truth with whom the contributors wish to engage in debate. We now turn to the essays in Engaging with Keller to consider whether some specific aspects of Keller&#39;s teaching are biblically accurate ways of transmitting the Reformed faith</p><p></p><h2>The Will to Govern Well: Knowledge, Trust, and Nimbleness</h2><p>Any look inside an association reveals challenges that require change in governance systems. These challenges include shifts in the balance of power, in policy making, and in measures of success. Associations must understand increasingly complex member segments and need to be able to respond to specialized needs. Increased demands for tangible benefits and bottom-line measures mean that associations need to think differently about how they create value for their members and how they measure success. <i>The Will to Govern Well</i> presents research into associations that have shifted from more traditional governance structures created with the intent to predict performance and replicate past successes to knowledge-based governance systems, which can more reliably function in a world characterized by rapid change. This book is about developing strategies for change in governance. It rejects the idea of wholesale revolution in favor of rapid evolution, which has the added benefit of decreasing resistance among members and stakeholders, who similarly reject such terms.<p> The book presents three critical themes that have emerged as key to developing the will to govern well knowledge, trust, and nimbleness providing definitions and strategies for incorporating them into governance. This second edition updates the original edition with information and insights that have been gleaned in the 10 years since its first publication. Furthermore, it includes a whole new chapter on the intelligent association, providing an evolved process for associations that have been using knowledge-based governance so routinely it has become part of the fabric of their operation. Another new feature of this edition is an emerging theory about the value proposition of associations in the 21st century.</p></p><p><b>Glenn H.

Lewis was a leading authority on English-language skills, whose bestselling <i>30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary</i> published by Pocket Books in&nbsp;1971 promised to teach readers to improve their skills in fifteen minutes a day. He started his teaching career at New York University and the City College of New York. From 1964 to 1995, he taught English&#x2014;including grammar, etymology, and vocabulary&#x2014;at Rio Hondo College, a two-year community college in Whittier, California. For more than a decade, he was also the chairman of Rio Hondo&#x2019;s communications department.<b><i> Give Us Fifteen Minutes a Day </i></b> <p> Your boss has a bigger vocabulary than you have. </p><p> That's one good reason why he's your boss. </p><p> This discovery has been made in the word laboratories of the world Not by theoretical English professors, but by practical, hard-headed scientists who have been searching for the secrets of success. </p><p> After a host of experiments and years of testing they have found out: </p><p> That if your vocabulary is limited your chances of success are limited. </p><p> That one of the easiest and quickest ways to get ahead is by consciously building up your knowledge of words. </p><p> That the vocabulary of the average person almost stops growing by the middle twenties. </p><p> And that from then on it is necessary to have an intelligent plan if progress is to be made. No hit-or-miss methods will do. </p><p> It has long since been satisfactorily established that a high executive does not have a large vocabulary merely because of the opportunities of his position. That would be putting the cart before the horse. Quite the reverse is true. His skill in words was a tremendous help in getting him his job. </p><p> Dr. Johnson O'Connor of the Human Engineering Laboratory of Boston and of the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, gave a vocabulary test to one hundred young men who were studying to be industrial executives. </p><p> Five years later, <i>all</i>, without exception, of those who had passed in the upper 10 per cent had executive positions, while <i>not a single young man of the lower 25 per cent had become an executive</i>. </p><p> Some of the factors that lead to success can be measured as scientifically as the contents of a test tube, and it has been discovered that the one and only common characteristic of outstandingly successful people is "an extensive knowledge of the exact meaning of English words." </p><p> Vocabulary is one indication of intelligence. Learning power measurably sharpens when vocabulary increases. Here's the proof. </p><p> Two classes in a high school were selected for an experiment The ages and background of the members of both groups were the same, and each group represented a similar cross-section of the community. Otoe, the control class, took the normal courses. The other class had, in addition, special and rigorous vocabulary training. At the end of the period the grades of the students in the vocabulary class surpassed the grades of the members of the control group, not only in English, but in every other subject, including mathematics and the sciences. </p><p> Similarly, Professor Lewis M. Terman of Stanford University has found that a vocabulary test is as accurate a measure of intelligence as any three units of the standard and accepted Stanford-Binet I. Q. tests. </p><p> Words are the tools of thinking. It naturally follows, then, that the more words you have at your command, the clearer and more accurate your thinking will be. </p><p> Words are your medium of exchange, the coin with which you do business with all those around you. With words you relate to people, communicate your feelings and thoughts to them, influence them, persuade them, control them. In short, through words you shape your own destiny.

A single word can destroy a friendship, can start or end a marital battle, can land a large order. The right phrases in the mouths of clerks have quadrupled the sales of a department store.

By chance they stumble across a naked woman in a coffin with a stake driven through her heart. Was she a vampire or the victim of a gruesome murder?</p><p>Richard Laymon was born in Chicago in 1947 and grew up in California. Four of his books have been shortlisted for the Bram Stoker Award, which he won in 2001 with THE TRAVELLING VAMPIRE SHOW. Among his many acclaimed works of horror and suspense are THE STAKE, SAVAGE, AFTER MIDNIGHT and the four novels in the Beast House Chronicles: THE CELLAR, THE BEAST HOUSE, THE MIDNIGHT TOUR and FRIDAY NIGHT IN BEAST HOUSE. He died in February 2001.Laymon's first hard-cover since his first book (The Cellar, 1980, not reviewed)--and a fine return it is as this high- spirited, prolific horror writer weighs in with a typically brisk and black-humored yarn about what a fellow horror author and his pals do when they find the stake of the title--embedded in a mummified corpse. Is the corpse a vampire? The Colorado ghost town where horror novelist Larry Durban, his neighbor Pete, and their wives find the body is eerie enough, but none of the four believes in vampires--although whoever killed the woman must have thought her a monster, and wouldn't all this make a nifty nonfiction book? So Larry writes several chapters about finding the corpse and about how he and Pete later returned to the hotel and stole the body, now hidden in Larry's garage awaiting his book-in-progress's climax, the pulling of the stake. Larry postpones that climax, though, because as he digs out the identity of the body--local high-school cheerleader Bonnie Saxon, a dead-ringer for his own daughter Lane but murdered 20 years back, along with several other girls, by one Uriah Radley--he becomes erotically obsessed with Bonnie, waking up next to her corpse. Meanwhile, in a major, thematically obvious subplot--monsters do exist--a real-life fiend invades Larry's family: Lane's English teacher, handsome Mr. Kramer, who molests and murders one of Lane's classmates, then sets his sights on flirtatious Lane, eventually raping her. And at the same time, Uriah Radley, escaped from an asylum and gripping a stake, tracks after Larry &amp; Co., whom he believes to be vampires. All parties converge in a violent and twisty climax that spirals into a truly surprising, and surprisingly happy, ending. Spooky, sexy, and lots of nasty fun. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He contests the view that only science offers an appropriate model for philosophical inquiry. His discussion of topics from artificial intelligence to natural selection, and of reductive philosophical views derived from these models, identifies the insuperable problems encountered when philosophy ignores the normative or attempts to reduce it to something else. </p></p><p>A renewal of philosophy is precisely the point of this book, drawn from the 1989 Gifford Lectures by one of America&#39;s most distinguished philosophers. In a wide-ranging survey of major issues, Hilary Putnam proposes a revitalized approach to philosophical questions. Putnam contests the view that only science offers an appropriate model for philosophical inquiry, that only a metaphysics congruent with physics suffices, while questions of art and ethics, love, death, and religion must be set aside due to the lack of an adequate language or perspective. His discussion of topics from artificial intelligence to natural selection, and of reductive philosophical views derived from these models, identifies the insuperable problems encountered by philosophy when it ignores the normative or attempts to reduce it to something else. Looking for a better way of doing philosophy, Putnam takes up the problems posed by religious discourse - often viewed by philosophers as prescientific and primitive, an unlikely survivor from the age of superstition. In luminous pages on Wittgenstein, he refutes this view and shows how the philosopher&#39;s frequently misunderstood forays into religious discourse actually open up philosophy to a broad range of practical, moral, and political issues. In closing, Putnam considers Dewey, who occupies a middle ground between metaphysics and skepticism, and whose broadly epistemological arguments in favor of democracy this book eloquently advances. Written in Putnam&#39;s characteristically lucid and engaging style, this is a compelling call to reject the confusions and reductions that obscure the human issues which it has always been philosophy&#39;s highest goal to articulate.Hilary Putnam was Cogan University Professor, Emeritus, at Harvard University.</p><h2>This Time</h2><p>This Time starts moments before Richard III loses to Henry Tudor on Bosworth Field near Leicester, England on August 22, 1485, when a team of Ricardians (people trying to restore the name and reputation of Richard III) substitute an armor clad corpse for the king and bring him into Portland, Oregon. Richard awakens August 21, 2004 to an alien world where even the English he speaks is different.The story follows two parallel paths: the present where Richard must learn how to adjust to not only the technological advancements but also the more difficult cultural differences; and looking back at the past to solve some of the mysteries that have haunted and maligned his image for over 500 years.</p><p>Joan Szechtman came to writing and history by a rather circuitous route, after first focusing on her career in engineering and computer science.

Her daughter Ruby is a struggling comedienne. The two haven&#x2019;t spoken in more than a decade. Then a scandal from Nora&#x2019;s past is exposed, and Ruby is offered a fortune to write a tell-all about her mother. Reluctantly she returns to the family house on Summer Island, a home filled with frayed memories of joy and heartache. Confronting a past that includes a never-forgotten love, a sick best friend, and a mother who has harbored terrible family secrets, Ruby finally begins to understand the complex ties that bind a mother and daughter� and the healing that comes with forgiveness.</p></p><p>Few authors dare to truly analyze the complex natures of mother-daughter relationships. In her novel <i>Summer Island</i>, author Kristin Hannah perfectly captures the bittersweet, inspiring, disappointing, tragic, and human aspects of such a relationship. Set in the tranquil, present-day San Juan Islands, <i>Summer Island</i> presents itself as a deep investigation of the ramifications of a mother's abandonment of her two daughters. Unlike many similar novels, this one delivers the goods.<p> When Nora Bridge left her husband and her two daughters 10 years ago, she took the only route she could see, and assumed she still had her daughters' love. Now, though she is distant from her own daughters, Nora is the hostess of a radio advice show, where she advises listeners that "family comes first." When a scandal breaks and Nora hits rock bottom, she finds she has to rely on the two people she has betrayed most deeply: her daughters, Ruby and Caroline.</p><p> As an aspiring and failing comedian, Ruby's life in Los Angeles has shrunk into a directionless morass. She says when she dismisses superstition, "As if she needed magic to tell her that she was stuck in the spin cycle of her life." Though neither she nor Caroline are inclined to help their mother, Ruby finally agrees when a magazine offers to pay her for a tell-all expos�.</p><p> With a masterful balance of cutting wit, realistic dialogue, and lyrical description, <i>Summer Island</i> is by far Hannah's greatest work. Mothers, daughters, and sisters are sure to mark the passages and lend this novel to each other. If this is the standard for future Hannah novels, her fan base is sure to grow.<i>--Nancy R.E.

She has since become a famous radio talk-show host and newspaper columnist beloved for her moral advice. Her youngest daughter, Ruby, is a struggling comedienne who uses her famous mother as fuel for her bitter, cynical humor. When the tabloids unearth a scandalous secret from Nora's past, their estrangement suddenly becomes dramatic: Nora is injured in an accident and a glossy magazine offers Ruby a fortune to write a tell-all about her mother. Under false pretenses, Ruby returns home to take care of the woman she hasn't spoken to for almost a decade. <br><br>Nora insists they retreat to Summer Island in the San Juans, to the lovely old house on the water where Ruby grew up, a place filled with childhood memories of love and joy and belonging. There Ruby is also reunited with her first love and his brother. Once, the three of them had been best friends, inseparable. Until the summer that Nora had left and everyone's hearts had been broken. . . . <br><br>What began as an expose evolves, as Ruby writes, into an exploration of her family's past. Nora is not the woman Ruby has hated all these years. Witty, wise, and vulnerable, she is desperate to reconcile with her daughter. As the magazine deadline draws near and Ruby finishes what has begun to seem to her an act of brutal betrayal, she is forced to grow up and at last to look at her mother--and herself--through the eyes of a woman.

The discovery of the notes for his major lecture on the motion of planets around the sun, presented in this book, allows readers an insight into the workings of his mind. The book relates how the notes came to be lost, and how they came to be found again and reconstructed. The lecture concerns the fact that, when a planet or any other body arcs through space under the influence of gravity, it traces out a specific set of mathematical curves. Feynman considers why nature chooses to trace out in the sky those - and only those - elegant geometrical constructions.</p><p>Richard Feynman, the rock star of theoretical physics, has left an image that belies his nerdy side. Not many bongo-playing surfer beatniks would have spent hours of their spare time proving Newton's law of elliptical planetary motion using only plane geometry. But <i>Feynman's Lost Lecture: The Motion of Planets Around the Sun</i> shows that the great man did just that. Originally delivered to an introductory physics class at Caltech in 1963, this 76-minute CD and book set contains everything the math-savvy listener needs to savor the pleasures of applied math. Caltech physicist David L. Goodstein and archivist Judith R. Goodstein found the notes and tape amid another professor's papers and set to work making sense of them; unfortunately, photographs of the blackboard drawings didn't survive. The book briefly covers their find and recovery work, then presents the proof as reconstructed--crucial reading if one is to follow the lecture. There's nothing easy about it, as Feynman acknowledges in the lecture: <blockquote> I am going to give what I will call an elementary demonstration. "Elementary" means that very little is required to know ahead of time in order to understand it, except to have an infinite amount of intelligence. </blockquote> He means, instead, that he is strictly using geometrical methods to reach his destination, which explains why it was so difficult to reconstruct without his diagrams. His charming Brooklyn accent and good humor show through in this lecture, even if the material is quite a bit drier than his fans might expect. Still, those interested in adding a new dimension to their understanding of this brilliant scientist--and those with a deep interest in Newtonian physics--will find <i>The Motion of Planets Around the Sun</i> a rare and unexpected treat. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>On March 13, 1964, Feynman delivered a lecture to the Caltech freshman class, &#34;The Motion of Planets Around the Sun&#34;why the planets move elliptically instead of in perfect circles. For reasons unknown, most probably for his own amusement, he chose to make the argument using mathematics no more advanced than high-school plane geometry. Isaac Newton had pulled off much the same trick nearly 300 years earlier in his masterpiece, the Principia. Feynman, unable to follow Newton&#39;s obscure proof, invented his own original, geometrical proof in the Caltech lecture. The subject of Feynman&#39;s lecture was the watershed discovery that separated the ancient world discovery that separated the ancient world from the modern world - the culmination of the Scientific Revolution. Before Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, the universe was Earth-centered. After their discoveries, our idea of the universe steadily altered and expanded, moving outward to the infinity we try to understand in our own time. Thus Feynman deals here with a crowning achievement of the human mind, comparable to Beethoven&#39;s symphonies. Shakespeare&#39;s plays, or Michelangelo&#39;s Sistine Chapel. Feynman conclusively demonstrates the astonishing fact that has mystified and intrigued all deep thinkers since Newton&#39;s time: Nature obeys mathematics. For thirty years this brilliant and seminal lecture lay dormant in the Caltech archives. Now, in this book, Feynman&#39;s lost lecture has been reconstructed and explained in meticulous detail together with a history of ideas of the planets&#39; motions.

Photography by Patrice de Villiers</h2><p>This collection of portraits has been created in the name of Teenage Cancer Trust and predominantly features those artists who have supported the charity over the years, whether taking part in the annual Royal Albert Hall shows, visiting wards, donating a multitude of gifts from signed amps to signed sunglasses or getting involved in projects such as Love Music Love Food. Artists new to the charity have become involved with the project and their relationship with Teenage Cancer Trust started here at Love Music Love Food. It's a great testament to Teenage Cancer Trust that these artists feel passionately about supporting the charity to the point that they'll be smothered in Marmite, have their knees nibbled by sheep, cuddle chickens or get pelted with Dayglo cupcakes to help make a difference. We salute and thank you for being a part of this project.

Her first commission as a photographer was for The Sunday Times food page shooting a year-long series of food portraits, which coincided with her first cookbook being commissioned by Quadrille. Patrice works on editorial and advertising projects for an impressive range of clients, from Selfridges, fine art commissions for state of the art hotels in Las Vegas, illustrating racing driver's breakfast's for Toyota F1 magazine, to Marks &amp; Spencer and Harper's Bazaar. Her iconic imagery is also available to buy through the Saatchi Gallery Online. Love Music Love Food is Patrice's lovechild, bringing her expertise in the world of food photography to the world of music and vice versa. It brings her beginnings, when she shot bands in Manchester, full circle. In this unique book she brings the sensual beauty of food to music - and gives gastronomy a rock and roll edge. Patrice loves tea, taking pictures of food, particularly squid and going to gigs. She lives and works just off London's Old Kent road in a converted pub with her boyfriend Ru and their son, Dylan. Interviews by Andrew Harrison: Andrew Harrison is a music and pop culture journalist who has written for Q, Mojo, GQ, The Guardian, The Face and Rolling Stone. He started writing gig reviews for the Liverpool Echo to escape working in his father's butcher's shop, and in the 1990s he edited much-loved rock monthly Select, which famously coined the term 'Britpop'. He is presently Editor-at-Large at The Word, the much-acclaimed music magazine for grown-ups. Andrew has interviewed U2, Madonna, the Wu Tang Clan, Stephen Fry, Samuel L Jackson and more pop stars than he can remember. In the course of duty he has had his car insulted by Morrissey, he's taken numerous highly strung telephone calls from Courtney Love, and he once joined rave legends Altern 8 onstage in Cologne where he was forced to climb up and down a ladder during the entire show for 'atmosphere'. He now lives in North London with his wife, a cat and a 40,000-song iTunes music library. Favourite food: Homemade sausages. Recipes by Sarah Muir: Sarah Muir has cooked for bands, artists and their crews for more than 20 years, travelling the world with some of the most fantastic music and people including Bob Dylan, Radiohead, George Michael, The Prodigy and Oasis. Life on the road with bands can be a wild time, but it's always filled with fun and laughter.

Mr. Freedman lives in New York City.Grade 5-8 --As in Lincoln: A Photobiography (Clarion, 1987), Freedman has taken a larger-than-life historical figure about whom innumerable volumes have been written and has retold the story of one man's life in the context of his times. The carefully researched, highly readable text and extremely effective coordination of black-and-white photographs chronicle Roosevelt's priviledged youth, his early influences, and his maturation. Drawing on first-hand observations of his family, friends, and enemies, as well as Roosevelt's own diary entries, Freedman formulates a composite picture of a complex, enigmatic individual and a consummate politician. Roosevelt's public career is given further significance because of the cataclysmic events of the Depression and the tumultuous war years during his presidency. As controversial as many of his programs and policies were or have come to be, no one could ever call to question his dedication, his initiative, or the energy he brought to the job. His all too human shortcomings are just as clearly delineated.

The book explores the efficiency of wood compared to other fuels, the environmental impacts of various fuel types as well as sustainability issues that have led to so many adopting a wood-burning lifestyle. </p><p> Heating with wood does more than keep a house warm. Though it can be a hands-on expression of self-reliance, it does bring us closer to the land by using fuel that is renewable and sustainably harvested, and renews our wonder in the cycle of the seasons. And the biggest benefit is that wood heat saves money in the long run. </p><p> There are four ways that wood can be used to heat a home or cottage: wood stoves (the most popular), fireplace inserts, pellet stoves and masonry heaters. <i>Wood Heat</i> explains the pros and cons of each. </p><p> The book provides all of the information and advice needed to convert to a wood-heated life. How-to topics include step by step directions. They include: </p><ul> <li> The comparative advantages of heating with wood </li> <li> Buying, cutting, splitting, stacking, storing and moving firewood </li> <li> Building the perfect woodpile </li> <li> Varieties of wood and their burning characteristics </li> <li> The latest technology for burning wood efficiently and cleanly </li> <li> Energy content of wood varieties per air-dried cord (BTUs) </li> <li> Catalytic and non-catalytic stoves </li> <li> Cooking with a wood stove </li> <li> How to make a good fire </li> <li> Essential hearth and fireplace tools </li> <li> Sizing wood-burning appliances </li> <li> A chimney maintenance checklist. </li> </ul><p></p><p> Currently, over 10 million U.S. households use wood as their main heating fuel or to supplement other forms of heating. Unstable, increasing fuel costs and the desire of many people to move toward self-sufficiency will only increase the numbers of those choosing to burn wood for heat. <i>Wood Heat</i> is the ideal guide for all. </p></p><p><p> As an editor for St. Remy Press and Reader's Digest, Andrew Jones has worked on a wide variety of books, from Time-Life's <i>Art of Woodworking</i> series to several editions of <i>The Top 10 of Everything</i>, <i>The Complete Road Atlas of Canada</i> and <i>True North Strange and Free</i>. He lives in Oakville, Ontario. </p><p>Introduction </p><p> Why Wood? </p><p> In this day and age, is it reasonable to heat with wood when more efficient sources of energy exist? Is wood really cheaper? Is the wood-burning lifestyle for you? This book seeks to answer these questions. It explores everything from how to source, choose and purchase wood and how to season, split, stack and store it to how to build and tend fires. It explains the differences between wood-burning appliances, and it provides advice on how to heat your residence safely, whether you are warming your living room or your entire home. </p><p> Those who've had the experience would agree that there are few things more comforting in life than basking in the warmth of a crackling wood fire as the day draws to a close. Yet it's also true that heating with wood provides benefits which extend well beyond basic comfort and warmth: Wood is a sustainable fuel that can be harvested ethically and burned cleanly, and doing so can result in a great sense of personal satisfaction and well-being. </p><p> But if wood is a relatively inexpensive, renewable source of energy with such tremendous potential, why don't more people heat with it? Why isn't it part of energy policy discussions by local, regional and national governments? Why is heating with wood still largely seen as a quaint backwoods pursuit? </p><p> The answer to the first question is practical. Home heating with wood on an urban scale is unrealistic, for reasons that start with basic distribution and space. Unlike other renewable sources of energy that come straight to your house, such as electricity and natural gas, firewood requires a lot of dedicated space if you are to use it to warm a single-family dwelling through a frigid northeastern winter. </p><p> Another drawback to heating with wood is air pollution. Wood that is not burned properly creates noxious smoke, and as a result, it is strictly regulated in many municipalities throughout Canada and the United States. Older stoves and fireplaces that don't burn wood as cleanly and efficiently as newer appliances can exacerbate this problem, creating more smoke. Burning wood is thus often seen as a nuisance rather than a beneficial resource. </p><p> Yet when all things are considered, the advantages of heating with wood in some settings can handily outweigh the disadvantages, as we'll learn. Wood is a sustainable resource that requires little processing, one that limits your furnace use and offers self-sufficiency when the power goes out. Sourcing and buying wood locally also keeps your energy dollars within the community and contributes to responsible resource management. </p><p> Make no mistake--there is a considerable financial, physical and lifestyle investment in deciding to heat a home with wood. This book is not for everyone. While many will appreciate the warm feeling heating with wood evokes, fewer will take the steps required to make it a reality. But those who do will be rewarded handsomely. </p><p> A Short History of Wood Burning </p><p> Humans have burned wood to keep warm for millennia. What many of us don't realize, however, is that the use of wood as our primary home-heating fuel was displaced only relatively recently. Indeed, residential wood burning was the main source of domestic heat throughout Canada and the United States until about 150 years ago, and for much of rural North America, wood was virtually the only practical heating-fuel option until after the Second World War. </p><p> After 1945, the use of firewood for home heating dropped rapidly. Many associated wood heating with rural poverty and hardship and embraced the widespread, convenient and inexpensive energy sources of the future. During the 1950s and 1960s, the practice of wood burning was largely relegated to decorative fireplaces installed in new single-family homes that were heated with oil, natural gas and electricity. During these pivotal decades, wood became a fuel of the past. Eventually, it came to be viewed mostly as a fuel for recreational use. </p><p> It took the energy crisis of the 1970s to rekindle interest in wood heating in North America. The triple threat of skyrocketing oil prices, high interest rates and the recession of the early 1980s put the squeeze on household budgets. For many families, switching to wood became the simplest way to stop the financial bleeding caused by soaring monthly home-heating bills. Suddenly, the fusty old woodstove became a symbol of Canadian and American resourcefulness, ingenuity and self-sufficiency. </p><p> The resurgence of the woodstove, however, created an entirely new set of problems. Until U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations came into effect in the late 1980s (followed by Canadian Standards Association (CSA) standards in 2000), wood-burning technology had been fairly crude. Most wood-burning appliances were little more than steel or cast-iron boxes in which to build a fire. Old cast-iron stoves and furnaces burned inefficiently, sending acrid smoke through long, leaky flue pipes to crumbling, unlined masonry chimneys. Gaskets on loading doors were rare. An entire continent rushed back to wood heating after decades of inattention and decline, and a generation of people with no collective memory of the dangers of house fires led to thousands of new wood-burning converts losing their homes. Wood heating suddenly became one of the leading causes of residential structural fires, and many people to this day retain the notion that wood heating is inherently hazardous.</p> <p>Throughout the 1980s, a concerted effort by all levels of government, the insurance industry and the wood-heating industry resulted in the development of safety standards and professional training programs. By the middle of the decade, the price of oil and other energy commodities had settled back to manageable levels, and the economy had recovered. Gradually, wood heating once again lost its glow, and the new and improved gas fireplace swiftly supplanted the woodstove. Even with the stock market crash of 1987, convenience trumped energy self-reliance for many. </p><p> Then came 1998. In January, a crippling ice storm shut down much of eastern Canada and the northeastern United States for weeks, and once again, the lowly woodstove and the wood-burning furnace saved the day for those lucky enough to own one. The following autumn, woodstove dealers could not keep up with demand by new customers, who didn't want to risk another winter without a solid home-heating backup plan. </p><p> That same year, geologists Colin Campbell and Jean Laherr�re published an article in Scientific American titled "The End of Cheap Oil." In it, they broached the notion of "peak oil" for the first time. The pair accurately foretold that the global peak of oil production was near. Once that peak was reached, the price of oil would begin to rise steadily and never fall again. Wood burning began to enjoy its second renaissance. </p><p> The good news is that by the turn of the 20th century, heating with wood had evolved dramatically. It is now safer, more efficient and less taxing. Where burning with wood once meant backbreaking work, crude stoves and dangerous chimneys, now portable chainsaws cut the work in half, the efficiency of the average woodstove has roughly doubled, to around 70 percent, chimney technology and safety have vastly improved, and rigorous building codes and recognized standards have been established for virtually every type of wood-burning appliance. </p><p> Wood-heating retailers, contractors, chimney sweeps and municipal and insurance inspectors now benefit from national training and certification programs. Trained professionals can rely on clear and comprehensive safety rules. Public information, much of it produced by both governments and industry groups, is putting to rest old fears about the dangers of wood burning. </p><p> As recently as the mid-1980s, wood burning was relegated to a basement wood furnace or a stout cast-iron woodstove. Today, heating with wood has become retro chic as many North Americans try to recapture memories of their childhood as they refit cott</p></p><h2>DK Eyewitness Books: Chicago</h2><p><p>Eyewitness: Chicago is a fully illustrated look at the history and geography of Chicago, Illinois.

He returns to England in time to receive a maternal death-bed curse and then, before he can get away again, is embroiled in a search for the "Stowey Van Gogh."

After a wealthy oilman plunges ten stories to his death from the balcony of a Miami hotel, Paz and the young cop who witnessed the fall discover a woman on her knees praying in the dead man's room. A motive and strong evidence point to the woman&#x2014;Emmylou Dideroff&#x2014;as the murderer, but she insists that she's innocent of the crime, while freely admitting her guilt in numerous other criminal acts and abominations. As her shocking confessions blur the lines between charity and vengeance, delusion and reality, Paz finds himself drawn once again into the unexplained . . . and into a collision with an evil of inconceivable power. </p></p><p>This top-notch novel confirms Gruber's place as a gifted writer who stretches the conventional bounds of the genre by placing the mysteries of faith and religious experience and the complexities of the human mind as well as spirit at the center of his work. It's a taut, compelling whodunit that's as far from a typical detective procedural as good is from evil and a worthy follow-up to his acclaimed debut (<i>Tropic of Night</i>) that also features Cuban-American cop Jimmy Paz. Here Gruber tells a mesmerizing tale of Emmylou Dideroff, who communes with saints and whose checkered past includes stints as a hooker, drug dealer, and the leader of a band of Sudanese freedom fighters. But did she kill the Arab businessman on a government "watch list" who plunged to his death from a Miami hotel? While that's the incident that brings her to Paz's attention, it's only one of his questions about this strange woman, whose unsettling "confessions" stir up the detective's confusion about his own deepest beliefs. Emmylou is as fascinating and fully realized as Jane Doe, the memorable protagonist of Gruber's first book--so too is Lorna Wise, the psychologist brought in to assess Emmylou's sanity, whose personal and professional lives are turned totally upside down by her involvement in the case and her relationship with Paz. This is a smart, riveting, wholly original and thoroughly fascinating book that's impossible to put down and leaves the reader with only one question--when is this author's next one coming out? <i>--Jane Adams</i><p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Michael Gruber is the author of five acclaimed novels.

(In some, but not all cases, substitutions have been suggested.) <p> Apart from "entrees," the book offers a tempting array of soups, pastas, and vegetable recipes such as Asparagus and Parmigiano Custard, Penette with Sea Scallops and Broccoli Florets, and Porcini Mushroom and Onion Soup. A small dessert chapter yields delicious finales like Venetian Fried Cream and Sweet Focaccia with Figs, plus an enticing selection of cookie formulas. The author also provides a brief tour of Venice, plus a discussion of its unique "flavors." Also helpful is seafood buying instruction, which includes the insight that smaller fish are more delicate and sweeter tasting than larger specimens. The book is illustrated with color photos. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>Damiano Martin lives in Venice, where he is the director of the Michelin-starred restaurant da Fiore, located in the historic San Polo district.

Eliot's reading of "The Waste Land," listeners may be inclined to hang up the earphones for a spell. There are no flaws to Eliot's steady-toned interpretation; in fact, his delivery is quite remarkable in its ability to match the poem's constant, somber mood.

Eugene Steuerle argues that these seemingly separable economic and political problems are actually symptoms of a common disease, one unique to our time. Unless that disease and the history of how it spread over time is understood, Steuerle says, it is easy for politicians and voters alike to fall prey to believing in simple but ineffective nostrums, hoping that a cure lies merely in switching political parties or reducing the deficit or protecting and expanding our favorite program.</p><p>Despite the despairing claims of many, Steuerle points out that we no more live in an age of austerity than did Americans at the turn into the twentieth century with the demise of the frontier. Conditions are ripe to advance opportunity in ways never before possible, including doing for children and the young in this century what the twentieth did for senior citizens, yet without abandoning those earlier gains. Recognizing this extraordinary but checked potential is also the secret to breaking the political logjam that&#x2015;as Steuerle points out&#x2015;was created largely by now dead (or retired) men.</p></p><p><p><b>C.

There is a wide variety of styles and subjects shown and step by step photographs show how to paint 10 beautiful paintings.</p><p>Wendy Jelbert is a teacher and a professional artist who works with pastels, oils, acrylics, inks, and watercolors. She is the author of several books, including "Wendy Jelbert's Line &amp; Wash" and "Wendy Jelbert's Water-Soluble Pencils." Carole Massey is a practicing instructor and an exhibiting artist. She is the author of "Figures in Watercolour," "Flowers in Acrylics," and "Water Soluble Pencils." David Hyde is a self-taught artist and the author of "Landscapes in Acrylics."Three artists demonstrate their own unique ways of using acrylics, making this book very colourful and varied. This book offers ten demonstrations for you to follow to improve your techniques with over 200 photographs. I recognised at least one image that has been previously published in a Search Press book, but I believe most of the subject matter and demonstrations are original to this book. Find techniques for creating texture and a whole host of other ideas. Learn to paint landscapes, animals, scenes, flowers and seas. An excellent introduction to acrylic painting.-KarenPlatt.co.uk A great book for all acrylic enthusiasts, from complete beginners to the medium to more experienced artists. Its full of advice on materials techniques and helpful tips. Wendy gives some useful help on playing with acrylics and shows us just how versatile a medium the can be - we can use them as watercolours, as oils and also use a variety of different techniques to create interesting and unusual effects. She shows us some of her paintings and explains which techniques she used to achieve the final effects and also gives us two detailed step by step demonstrations using many of the points she has already outlined. David continues with solutions to the popular comments that acrylics dry too quickly or are not subtle enough. He tells us just how great they are because they can be used in many different ways on a variety of surfaces. In his section of the book he covers Landscapes and gives us a brief but important overview of composition using two photographs of the same subject to use to create a compositionally pleasing painting. He further illustrates his comments by way of showing his own paintings and how the eye is lead into and round the painting by way of composition. He shows us the most useful colours for painting landscapes and gives hints on using Tone and Colour. This is followed by three detailed demonstrations, each accompanied by other of his works showing what he wants to achieve in each. Carol Massey then covers flowers. She shares her expertise giving advice on colours, drawing flowers and how to place flowers to create paintings that have an interesting composition. Carols advice covers how to use acrylics as watercolours and the benefits of this and how to use them impasto in knife paintings. Flower colours can be difficult to get right and she shows us her favourite colours and gives advice on how to mix and what colours to use to suit different types of flower. I found her advice on thinking of flower heads as simple geometric shapes very useful, simplifying what can seem a daunting task. She shares some of her own paintings and some thoughts about how and why she chose the methods she used. These are followed by three demonstrations using some of the techniques she has explained. Wendy then introduces a final section on the many and varied techniques that can be used with acrylics to create interesting and realistic textural effects. This book brings together in one place some useful material from other books in the leisure arts series. For artists it gives a valuable insight into different ways of working with acrylics, showing how useful and versatile a medium they can be and how wide ranging their potential is.-JeannieZelos.com Each of these step-by-step books on drawing, watercolour and acrylics draws on the experience of experts of the medium. There are general chapters, which serve as a basis from which to work up, but specific topics are allocated to one of the many experts. This demonstrates distinctions in style and explains the techniques behind them. It's rare to find guides that successfully cater to so many levels of ability. The opening chapters are dedicated to the beginner, with plenty of focus on mixing colour. However, these books are not just for the uninitiated - all three hold plenty of precious knowledge nuggets for even the most seasoned artists: acrylic texture and lighting in watercolour are both exacting matters and not for the fair-weather painter. All three volumes share more or less the same format; pages littered with plenty of pictures and short bursts of text, so that readers don't have to wade through excessive information in order to get to the point. The study topics are traditional, with nature and animals featuring almost exclusively, and you can't help thinking that each volume could benefit from branching out, even if for just one chapter, into something a little less conventional. Although three entirely separate books, and more than valid on their own, there is something attractive about linking them as a comprehensive learning experience, with disciplines from three different areas serving to complement each other.-Artists &amp; Illustrators Capture nature's most beautiful masterpieces on canvas with lessons from three experts in the art of acrylic painting. Wendy Jelbert starts with the basics - sketching, playing with colors, creating texture, painting puffy clouds and brilliant sunsets...that kind of thing. Then it's all about lilac, lilies, roses and primulas as Carole Massey shows you how to create a garden's worth of beautiful posies with this surprisingly forgiving medium. Beyond that, David Hyde introduces you to the world of landscape painting, showing you how to paint ancient trees, still waters and majestic mountains. With 10 easy to follow demonstrations, this book is ideal for beginners and painters looking to expand their skills.-Crafter's Choice Search Press is renowned for its high quality, great value books, and it lives up to its reputation with its new series of step-by-step guides covering key topics in drawing and painting. Each book is written by a range of well-respected artists, thus providing varied approaches to each topic or medium. Some readers might note that these titles draw together elements from the Leisure Arts series. They do not, however, feel like patchwork texts, and unless you already have the full set of the earlier smaller works, these compilations provide fantastic value for money. The books all have a similar structure, starting with chapters covering the basics of the topic, thereby making them very accessible for beginners. For example, in Drawing Step-by-Step, Richard Box introduces the subject by looking at fundamental drawing techniques and a wide range of suitable media, interspersed with step-by-step demonstrations; whilst in the Watercolour Painting title, there is an exploration of techniques, media, composition, colour and tone. Following these introductory sections, various experts provide instruction on their specialist topics, developing skills, and providing further inspiration. The Acrylic Painting and Drawing books are constructed with defined chapters, whilst the Watercolour Painting book, created by seven artists, appears more fluid, concealing any sense of it being a compilation of other texts. In the Acrylic Painting guide, for instance, David Hyde and Carole Massey follow on from Wendy Jelbert's introduction, which demonstrates the flexibility of the medium, providing specific guidance on their specialist subjects; landscape and flower painting respectively. Wendy then completes the book by sharing a range of her exciting ideas for creating texture. In the book on drawing, Box's introductory section is followed by Ronald Swanwick on drawing landscapes; Denis John Naylor on trees; Sally Michel on pets; and finally Carole Massey on water-soluble pencils. Each book contains at least ten full step-by-step demonstrations, with panels detailing materials. The wide range of subjects and approaches allows readers to move on to more advanced techniques, making the books appealing to artists of all levels.

Her fascinating and wide-ranging work provides clear explanations of the science surrounding keystone predators and considers how this notion can help provide practical solutions for restoring ecosystem health and functioning.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eisenberg examines both general concepts and specific issues, sharing accounts from her own fieldwork to illustrate and bring to life the ideas she presents. She considers how resource managers can use knowledge about trophic cascades to guide recovery efforts, including how this science can be applied to move forward the bold vision of rewilding the North American continent. In the end, the author provides her own recommendations for local and landscape-scale applications of what has been learned about interactive food webs.<br> &nbsp;<br> At their most fundamental level, trophic cascades are powerful stories about ecosystem processes&#x2014;of predators and their prey, of what it takes to survive in a landscape, of the flow of nutrients. <i>The Wolf's Tooth </i>is the first book to focus on the vital connection between trophic cascades and restoring biodiversity and habitats, and to do so in a way that is accessible to a diverse readership.</p><p>Cristina Eisenberg is a conservation biologist at Oregon State University, College of Forestry, and Boone and Crockett Fellow who studies how wolves affect forest ecosystems throughout the West."A scientist with a poet's command of language, Cristina Eisenberg writes with precision and passion . . . takes her reader on a breathtaking, sometimes heartbreaking tour of the planet from the Gulf of Maine to the Amazonian rain forests, the tropical coral reefs to old growth forests of the Northwest as well as rivers, lakes, and wetlands.

(<i>Austral Ecology</i>)<br><br>"A fascinating book. If you want to know more about the relationship between animals and the land they live in it's a worthwhile read with the potential to open many people's hearts, minds and eyes." (<i>Wolf Print</i>)<br><br>"Eisenberg is that rare writer who blends accessible descriptions of science with a lyrical sensitivity to the spiritual qualities of nature. Here, she uses these talents to present a highly readable summary of trophic cascades, the ripples felt through marine, terrestrial, and aquatic ecosystems when top predators are removed or reintroduced. The result of this blending of science and aesthetics is an engaging and even uplifting read. Highly recommended." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"This engaging book explores the reasons we need big predators and explains the most revolutionary idea found in contemporary ecology: trophic cascades. For nearly a century ecologists have believed that nature is democratic, governed from the bottom up by the amount of solar energy converted to green biomass, the food of herbivores. Eisenberg makes the case for the alternative view&#x2014;top-down control of ecosystems by predators and other keystone species&#x2014;while diplomatically exploring a path for reconciling these disparate views."

The magnificent home Sir Septimus built for his family has now been divided into apartments and turned into a boarding house. He intends to get rid of the boarders one at a time, starting with Meg Smiles. If his ghostly meddling works, Meg will secure a position with Count Etranger as advisor and companion to his sister, Princess Desiree, and leave the house for good. A job is just what Meg needs; she is in "reduced circumstances" since her odious cousin cut her allowance from her father's estate.

With the friendly tone of the home-taught, the author mixes advice on equipment and storage, methods of packing and freezing and many other tips with 250 recipes for baked goods. Readers should not be misled by his preference for whole-wheat and mixed-grain flours, as Haedrich's imaginative approach does not limit itself to the dull stuff commonly found in health-food baking.

He was undoubtedly the one man whom Kafka trusted more than any other, and it is to Brod, as his literary executor and editor, that we are indebted for rescuing and bringing to light Kafka's work. Out of a lifelong devoted friendship, Brod drew this account of Kafka's youth, family and friends, his struggle to recognize himself as a writer, his sickness, and his last days. <i>Franz Kafka</i> gives us not only a more vivid and lifelike picture of Kafka than that painted by any of his contemporaries, but also a fascinating portrayal of the complicated interaction between two writers of different temperaments but similar backgrounds who together helped shape the future of twentieth-century literature.</p><p><b>Max Brod</b>(1884&#x2013;1968) is best known for his historical novels and as the editor of Kafka's writings. He also wrote a biography of Heine, an autobiography, plays, poems, essays, and musical compositions.</p><h2>Yosef&#39;s Gift of Many Colors: An Easter Story</h2><p>His lavishly decorated egg reminds Yosef and the other villagers of God&#39;s love and miracles.</p><p></p><h2>T.S.Eliot&#39;s Poetry and Plays</h2><p>The American-English poet&#39;s limitations are lamented as his achievements are analyzed and lauded in this chronological study of his major works</p><p></p><h2>Death by Liberalism: The Fatal Outcome of Well-Meaning Liberal Policies</h2><p>Center-right conservative author J. R. Dunn offers a cogent analysis of how liberalism has not only failed as an ideology but has proven fatal to citizens and societies around the world. Dunn&#x2019;s piercing analysis of the Obama administration&#x2019;s perilous public policy agenda is a provocative, must-read rallying cry for Tea Party adherents, fans of Ann Coulter and Jonah Goldberg, or anyone concerned about the left&#x2019;s deadly impact on the future.</p><p><blockquote><p>More Americans have been killed by well-meaning liberal policies than by all the wars of the last century combined. J. R. Dunn not only analyzes the unintended consequences of liberal policies, but argues that these consequences have resulted in millions of fatalities in the United States and around the world.</p></blockquote><p>Liberalism sees itself as a rational and helpful philosophy that seeks to use the benign power of the government to improve our safety, health, and general welfare. In doing so, it relies on the authority of experts to devise the most rational means of realizing these goals. Unfortunately, when these well-meaning plans go awry, as they too often do, the results can be disastrous, even deadly. As J. R. Dunn persuasively argues in this thoroughly documented book, death by liberalism occurs in all fields and at all levels of society. Motorists, workers, even children taken under the state's protection&#x2014;all have fallen victim to liberal policies. What's more, the numbers are staggering. Liberalism can be implicated in the deaths of hundreds of thousands in this country, and millions worldwide.</p><p>Dunn's detailed and deliberative account takes no cheap shots but relies on well-established facts to show liberalism's fatal consequences in numerous aspects of our lives&#x2014;from crime and abortion to fuel-efficiency standards and the banning of DDT, from gun control to urban renewal. Dunn also pinpoints areas in which liberal interventions in the making are likely to produce more suffering and death, such as legal euthanasia, and identifies some of the leading liberals&#x2014;including George Soros&#x2014;behind the spread of these lethal initiatives.</p><p>J. R. Dunn is the author of three novels, <em>This Side of Judgment</em>, <em>Days of Cain</em>, and <em>Full Tide of Night</em>, and his work has been published in various magazines and anthologies.

Johnson rose from the welfare rolls of the Depression to become the most successful Black businessman in American history; the founder of <i>Ebony</i>, <i>Jet</i>, and <i>EM</i> magazines; and a member of the <i>Forbes 400</i>. Like the man himself,&nbsp;this autobiography&nbsp;is brash, inspirational, and truly unforgettable.</p><p>Black multimillionaire Johnson, assisted by Bennett, executive editor of Ebony magazine, recounts with simplicity, zest and humorous anecdotes how, as a 24-year-old from a small Mississippi River town, he parlayed a $500 loan into a publishing, cosmetics and insurance empire. Negro Digest , the first magazine he founded, was followed by Ebony (the first national black publication) and Jet . Thanks to success brought about by his sound social, business and political instincts, Johnson now enjoys a life spent "going first class," including owning a Palm Springs mountain-top home; participating in corporate board meetings (where he is accustomed to being the only black); and hobnobbing with the likes of Michael and Jesse Jackson and Gorbachev. Credited by some with "inventing" the black consumer market, Johnson is proudest of his role in reporting and abetting the crusade of Martin Luther King Jr. And despite his successes, he contends, without bitterness, that his millions could have been billions were it not for the "live wire of race." Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.According to Forbes magazine, Johnson is one of the 400 richest Americans. He is CEO of the Johnson Publishing Company, rated among the top 100 African-American-owned businesses. Born into poverty, Johnson was 15 years old when he moved from Arkansas City to Chicago. There he discovered the vast untapped potential of the black consumer marketplace, and in 1942, 24-year-old Johnson created his first magazine, Negro Digest , a phenomenal success soon followed by Ebony and Jet . By expanding into broadcasting, TV production, and cosmetics, Johnson has helped his company maintain a strong balance sheet. He has also held numerous diplomatic posts.

A short boat ride from Booth-bay Harbor, it was the perfect spot to spend time with my girlfriend Edith as we picked berries, listened to warblers singing high in the canopy, and examined all that grew in this tame fragment of northern nature.<br>But it was the seashore that brought us here. A luxuriant cover of slippery rockweeds, their air-filled bladders crackling under the pressure of our boots, gave way to mats of blue mussels and then to stands of waving kelp fronds as we descended to the low water mark. All the expected inhabitants of the rocky shore were here: spiny green sea urchins nestled in pools and among the kelp holdfasts, large hairy horse mussels crammed into sand pockets around boulders, rock crabs and green crabs hiding beneath sponge-lined ledges, sluggish dog whelks massing in crevices or perched atop prey barnacles, limpets clinging to and scraping crusts beneath rocks, and three kinds of periwinkle feasting on seaweeds. Gulls, always on the lookout for crabs, patrolled overhead. To judge from their large size and the many closely spaced growth interruptions on their weather-beaten shells, the blue mussels had been living their sedentary lives on this shore for decades. To us as naturalists, the shore and its surroundings exemplified the serenity and beauty that give nature and life meaning. To us as scientists, they posed questions and invited inquiry into the ways of the living world.<br>Grinding winter ice, breaking waves, intense competition for light and space, and a variety of predators&#x2014;crabs, lobsters, sea stars, whelks, fish, and gulls&#x2014;are part of life for every creature on this shore. Yet despite these dangers and despite the conflicting interests of the seaweeds and animals in this community, the species are well adapted to each other and to their rigorous physical surroundings. The secure attachment by flexible threads secreted from the foot protects mussels from being dislodged by shifting ice or powerful predators from rocks. Even when the threads fail and the mussels become detached, the bivalves can produce new threads and re-fasten themselves if they land in the right place. A mussel&#x2019;s two shell valves can shut tightly around the soft tissues, so that would-be attackers homing in on the chemical plume that a mussel releases while actively feeding and respiring loses the scent and finds another victim. When snails like dog whelks and periwinkles become dislodged, they quickly withdraw the delicate soft parts&#x2014;head, foot, and other organs&#x2014;far back in the shell, whose opening is sealed with a flexible yet tightly fitting doorlike device. Predatory sea stars, when directly contacting potential prey snails, often elicit a vigorous escape response. Sponges beneath overhangs secrete chemicals that enemy sea slugs find repellent. I could fill a book documenting the adaptations of every species on this relatively simple shore, let alone every living and fossil species on the planet.<br>The fact of adaptation&#x2014;the good fit between organism and environment&#x2014;was already well established by the time Charles Darwin and his collaborator and competitor Alfred Russel Wallace ushered in the evolutionary age with the presentation of their paper before the Linnean Society in London in 1858. All living things, including humans, effectively perform the essential functions of life&#x2014;growth, metabolism, food intake, defense, maintenance of the body, and reproduction&#x2014;in the places these organisms inhabit. Darwin and Wallace proposed one mechanism for adaptation, based on an idea borrowed from the English political economist Thomas Malthus&#x2014;the number of offspring produced in a population exceeds the number surviving to reproduce as adults. Survivors possess heritable characteristics&#x2014;those passed from generation to generation&#x2014;that enable living individuals to meet the challenges and capitalize on opportunities in their environment more effectively than the traits of those individuals that die before reaching maturity. Adaptation thus involves a selective process, which was called natural selection by Darwin, resulting from the culling of inadequately performing individuals in the struggle for life.<br>Bipedal locomotion&#x2014;running and walking on two legs&#x2014;is a good example of human adaptation. The bipedal condition evolved from the ancestral four-footed condition many times, as in kangaroos and several lines of dinosaurs, but in primates it is restricted to our own species (Homo sapiens) and other species of Homo, dating back to perhaps as early as two-and-a-half million years ago. Among running animals in general and bipeds in particular, humans are unusual in that they can run for long distances, up to six miles (ten kilometers) per day for someone in good physical health. Only a few other mammals&#x2014;wolves, hyenas, and African dogs that hunt in packs, as well as migrating horses and African wildebeest&#x2014;engage in comparable endurance running, but these animals run on all fours. Our two-legged, long-distance running is made possible by modifications in the leg bones, joints, tendons, muscles, and even our skin. Unlike other running mammals, we achieve high speed with a long stride of up to three-and-a-half meters (more than ten feet) in highly trained athletes. Traits contributing to this long stride include unusually long hind limbs, a relatively short and lightweight foot, the unique presence of the Achilles tendon connecting the heel with muscles in the foot, and short bundles of muscles that produce the forces necessary for sustained running. All the joints in our legs, from the foot to the pelvis, are conspicuously enlarged compared to those of apes and compared to the joints in our arms. This enlargement enables the body to absorb the strong forces produced when the feet hit the ground as we run. The copious heat generated by our muscles during running is lost through the skin, which in humans has unusually abundant sweat glands through which evaporation takes place. Human skin is also peculiar in lacking insulating hair over most of its surface. These and other departures from the primate norm represent adaptations that enabled our immediate ancestors to compete effectively with other predators for scarce, protein-rich meat in hot open country. Other distinctive human adaptations&#x2014;a large brain, delayed sexual maturity, the use of long-distance weapons, and the domestication of animals and plants&#x2014;came much later. In the early history of our genus Homo, however, running-related modifications gave us a decisive competitive edge in a place where the struggle for life was particularly intense.<br>Not every aspect of an organism represents an adaptation. Many features are simply expressions of how an individual grows, or how it is put together, much as the seam of a plastic cup indicates how the cup was manufactured. Most shells, for example, grow in the shape of a spiral, reflecting a pattern of growth in which new shell material is added only at the expanding end of what is effectively a conical enclosure. The spiral can be variously modified in adaptive ways, ranging from the loose, rapidly expanding spiral of a clam shell or a cap-shaped limpet to the tightly coiled spiral of many snails; but the spiral form itself is not a direct expression of adaptedness. Likewise, the growth marks on the exterior of a mussel shell or in the bones of reptiles and some dinosaurs indicate periodic interruptions in growth rather than some subtle adaptation, but here again many animals have fashioned growth marks into larger features that impart greater shell strength and other protective functions.<br>Individual traits may even be harmful in some situations. An actively feeding mussel, which pumps water through its gills in order to extract food particles as well as oxygen, necessarily releases metabolic products with the expelled water. These are beacons for potential predators like sea stars and snails. The disadvantages associated with this inadvertent advertisement must be compensated for by an ability to recognize the nearby presence of hungry predators and to respond quickly by shutting the shell temporarily so that the scent disappears.<br>The catalog of potentially harmful traits in humans is also long. In the human eye, for example, there is no vision in the hole through which the optic nerve passes from the light-gathering surface of the retina to the brain. There is thus a blind spot located some thirty degrees to the right of the point of focus of the right eye, and another thirty degrees to the left of the focal point of the left eye.<br>It may even be that most evolutionary changes are neutral or nearly neutral, and therefore impervious to natural selection. In all organisms, genetic material (DNA and RNA) consists of helically wound chains of nucleotides of four kinds: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine (or uracil). Some of this genetic material provides instructions for building proteins, which consist of long chains of twenty kinds of amino acids. In the sequence of three nucleotides that specifies a given amino acid, the third nucleotide of the sequence is typically silent&#x2014;that is, a switch from one nucleotide to another in this position leaves the amino-acid specification unchanged. These alterations are likely to be common, but they have no effect on an organism&#x2019;s adaptation; they are thus effectively neutral. Even mutations with mildly deleterious effects may become established under some conditions. In very small populations of five or fewer individuals, a mutation with a tiny disadvantage can persist because a random fluctuation in population size by one or two individuals has a much larger effect on the fate of that mutation than selection does on the trait that the mutation specifies. If species often originate as tiny populations of this size, as many biologists believe, this so-called random fixation through genetic drift may be an imp...</p></p><h2>Powersat: A Thriller of Technology, Terrorism, and Hope (The Grand Tour)</h2><p><p>Two hundred thousand feet up, things go horribly wrong.

Chr�tien loves to tell a good tale &#x2013; and he does so here in the same honest, plain-spoken style of <b>Straight from the Heart</b>, his earlier bestselling account of his years as a Cabinet minister. He gives us a self-portrait of a working prime minister &#x2013; the passionate Canadian renowned for finishing every speech with <i>Vive le Canada</i>!<br><br>Chr�tien knows how government works, and his political instincts are sharp. Through the decade 1993 to 2003 we watch as he wins three majority elections as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. Finding the country in a dreadful state, dangerously in debt and bitterly divided, he describes how his government wiped out the deficit in just four years, helped to defeat the separatists in the cliffhanger Quebec referendum, passed the <i>Clarity Act</i>, and set out to fulfill the economic and social promises his party made in its famous Red Books. He reveals how and why he kept the country out of the war in Iraq &#x2013; a defining moment for many Canadians; led Team Canada on whirlwind trade missions around the world; and participated in a host of major international summits.<br><br>Along with his astute comments on politics and government, he gives candid portraits of a broad cast of characters. Over a beer, Tony Blair confides his hesitation about taking Britain into the Iraq War; in the corridors of the United Nations, Bill Clinton offers to speak to Quebecers on behalf of Canadian unity; while at home, Chr�tien reveals the events leading up to the departure of his finance minister, Paul Martin. He recounts the dramatic night in which his quick-thinking wife, Aline, saved him from an assassination attempt at 24 Sussex Drive; and, with lively humour, he describes how he and Clinton successfully escaped from their own bodyguards &#x2013; to the consternation of all.<br><br>Even in the highest office in the land, Jean Chr�tien never lost his connection with ordinary Canadians. He is as warm and funny in his recollections as in person, at once combative and cool-headed, a man full of vitality and charm. Above all, from start to finish, his love for his country and his passion to keep it united run clear and deep.</p><p>The Rt. Hon. Jean Chr�tien was first elected to Parliament in 1963, at the age of twenty-nine. Four years later he was given his first Cabinet post and, over the next thirty years, he headed nine key ministries. From 1993 to 2003 he served as Canada&#39;s twentieth prime minister.<b>Entre Nous</b><br><br>1<br><br>Not long ago, in April 2007, I was in Moscow to attend the funeral of Boris Yeltsin, the former president of Russia and a person whom I greatly admired. He was a good man who spoke the truth, and his convictions changed the course of history, not only in his own country but around the world. The ceremony, full of dignity and beauty, took place in the cathedral that had been rebuilt to mark the return of freedom of religion in what had been the Soviet Union. Even a heathen would have bowed before the priests dressed in their majestic robes, and everyone present was moved to hear the old hymns of Mother Russia that so pierce the soul.<br><br>Looking around, I saw many former world leaders, now plain citizens, come to bid farewell to the one-time enemy who had later become their brother in arms. There was the elder George Bush, whose son I had gotten to know so well, and at his side foreign kings and presidents who seemed, in this holy place, mere mortals, as were we all. I said hello to John Major, the ex-prime minister of Great Britain, and we were joined by another famous retiree, though younger than either of us, Bill Clinton. When Bill and I shook hands on the steps of the church, I felt as though we were two parishioners meeting after Mass on a Sunday morning back home. With us was Lech Walesa, the former president of Poland, who had captured the imagination of the world when he was nothing but a courageous electrician from Gda&#x144;sk daring to defy the might of the Soviet Union. We talked of the good old days and of the present, which didn&#x2019;t seem so bad either, and swapping stories about our friend Boris reminded us of our own impermanence. The friendships and the memories warmed us in the cold spring air of Moscow, just as they continue to warm me in my advancing years. They are what propelled me to write this book, not to puff up my reputation but to record a moment in the all too brief span of time we human beings are given on earth.<br><br>Whether foreign or domestic, I&#x2019;ve always had a passion for politics. The other day I heard a young man say on television that he was standing for election because he wanted to serve. I said to myself, &#x201c;My friend, you seem nice, you have some charm, but you&#x2019;re not telling the whole truth. Going into politics is both simpler and more complicated than that.&#x201d; To be frank, politics is about wanting power, getting it, exercising it, and keeping it. Helping people comes with it naturally, because you&#x2019;ll never be elected if you treat people badly. But no one will ever convince me, with all the experience I&#x2019;ve had, that the motivations are strictly altruistic. No &#x2013; we throw ourselves into politics because we love it.<br><br>Politics is a sport in which the desire for victory is everything, because the ultimate reward is the power that lets you do some good for your constituents as a member of Parliament, for the stakeholders as a minister, and for the entire country and maybe even the rest of the world as prime minister. The more you succeed and the higher you climb, the more the wish to win becomes an obsession that consumes you day and night &#x2013; but also gives you satisfactions too numerous to count, from helping the unemployed in your riding find a job to sending Canadian peacekeepers to the rescue of besieged Bosnians. It&#x2019;s in that sense, I suppose, that you can say that you&#x2019;re in the game to serve, since politics gives you the opportunity to help others.<br><br>I was fortunate to have been given that opportunity. The joy of serving, to pick up on the young man&#x2019;s idea, allows you to forget all the miseries that come too &#x2013; when you freeze your feet campaigning from door to door; when the doors slam in your face; when the hand you extend is refused; when the neighbour you&#x2019;ve known all your life pretends not to see you across the street; when old friends betray you or laugh at you when you meet or, worse, behind your back. A dirty business, you say to yourself in those moments. I&#x2019;ve known many of their kind, but I&#x2019;ve also known how quickly the next victory erases them from memory.<br><br>This book picks up the political story of Canada, as I lived and breathed it, from where the updated edition of my earlier memoir, Straight from the Heart, left off, following my return to politics in January 1990 after a four�year absence, my election as leader of the Liberal Party the next June, and my time as leader of the Opposition until the autumn of 1993.<br><br>It is hard for most Canadians to remember how bleak our days looked at that point in our history. To be frank, Canada was in terrible shape &#x2013; exhausted, demoralized, and fractured. The federal, provincial, and municipal governments were virtually bankrupt, and their combined debt was greater than the country&#x2019;s total GDP, its gross domestic product. Unemployment was stuck at 11.4 per cent. Our interest rates seemed permanently fixed higher than U.S. rates, despite our lower inflation rate, and many of our best scientists, researchers, and scholars were leaving for greener pastures. Though none of that was solely the fault of nine years of Progressive Conservative rule, Ottawa had to bear the blame for creating a &#x201c;made in Canada&#x201d; recession &#x2013; one of the worst since the 1930s &#x2013; through its ideological monetary policy and its failure to help Canadian industry adapt to the new realities of free trade, financial globalization, and rapidly changing technology.<br><br>Moreover, because Prime Minister Brian Mulroney had defeated the Liberals in 1984 by promising to restore prosperity, reduce the debt and deficit, and create &#x201c;jobs, jobs, jobs,&#x201d; his government&#x2019;s record of broken promises, coupled with a string of corruption charges, ministerial resignations, and patronage appointments, produced a feeling of cynicism and betrayal that plunged public respect for Canada&#x2019;s politicians and democratic institutions to a historic low.<br><br>Even so, in my opinion, Mulroney might have survived to fight and win a third term if he hadn&#x2019;t also put the country in a constitutional pressure cooker, as though reopening the Constitution Act of 1982 was somehow going to solve the real problems we were facing as a people. He and I used to joke with each other in the House of Commons about the great fight it would be, him against me, and he had a twinkle in his eye whenever he spoke about winning the triple crown of a third majority. Instead, by using exaggerated rhetoric and divisive tactics to try to sell two successive constitutional packages to Canadians &#x2013; and then failing to deliver either one &#x2013; he reignited separatist sentiments in Quebec and rekindled a sense of alienation in Western Canada. As a result, his close friend and key lieutenant Lucien Bouchard quit the Tories and launched the Bloc Qu�b�cois, which was dedicated to advancing the cause of Quebec independence within the federal House; Preston Manning funnelled Western discontent into his populist movement, the Reform Party; and Mulroney himself, with his personal popularity level lower than the percentage of people who believed that Elvis Presley was still alive, decided to retreat from the field in February �1993.<br><br>Ten years later, at my retirement from public life on December 12, 2003, Canada was enjoying the longest period of economic expansion since the 1960s, Ottawa was on the verge of announcing its seventh surplus budget in a row, unemployment had fallen to around 7 per cent and was still dropping, the Parti Qu�b�cois had been defeated in Quebec, Western Canada had never been more prosperous, Canada&#x2019;s international reputation as an economic miracle and independent force for peace in the world had never been higher, and the Liberal Party of Canada was guaranteed by every poll and pundit to be ready to win its fourth consecutive majority. So how did this remarkable turnaround happen? What critical decisions or mistakes did we make along the way? Why did we choose one solution rather than �another?<br><br>My intention is not to produce a weighty, comprehensive account of the &#x201c;Chr�tien years.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ll leave that task to scholars and historians. Instead, I want to write an informative and highly personal recollection of my decade as prime minister &#x2013; to tell it as I saw it, to share a few entertaining stories as I do with my friends, to correct the record where necessary, to brag a bit, and to be as candid as possible. That said, I hope readers will understand and forgive me if I refrain from going into my family&#x2019;s private matters or commenting unnecessarily on the foibles and failures of individual personalities. No human being is perfect, and there are always more than enough people ready and eager to remind politicians of that fact every day of the week. I couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to write a warts�and�all description of the members of my staff and Cabinet or even of my political opponents. If that proves a weakness in the book, so be it, but it&#x2019;s a strength in life &#x2013; and especially in politics &#x2013; to learn to take people as they are and accept what they are not.<br><br>Another caveat: I have also limited myself to writing about events that occurred during my period in office. Except in a few places where I felt it necessary to mention what happened after December 2003 (and even there without much comment or detailed analysis), I don&#x2019;t believe that these memoirs are the proper forum in which to air my thoughts about subsequent political issues. In earlier drafts, however, I was prepared to jump ahead in time and write at some length about my successor&#x2019;s decision to launch the Commission of Inquiry into the Sponsorship Program under Mr. Justice John Gomery, partly because I understood the public&#x2019;s curiosity about my views, but mostly because I wanted to make use of the opportunity to express my grave concerns about the commission, its findings, and its ramifications.

Now, acclaimed productivity and quality experts Carla O'Dell and Jack Grayson explain for the first time how applying the ideas of Knowledge Management can help employers identify their own internal best practices and share this intellectual capital throughout their organizations. <p> Knowledge Management (KM) is a conscious strategy of getting the right information to the right people at the right time so they can take action and create value. Basing KM on three major studies of best practices at one hundred companies, the authors demonstrate how managers can utilize a visual process model to actually transfer best practices from one business unit of the organization to another. Rich with case studies, concrete examples, and revealing anecdotes from companies including Texas Instruments, Amoco, Buckman, Chevron, Sequent Computer, the World Bank, and USAA, this valuable guide reveals how knowledge treasure chests can be unlocked to reduce product development cycle time, implement more cost-efficient operations, or create a loyal customer base. Finally, O'Dell and Grayson present three "value propositions" built around customers, products, and operations that could result in staggering payoffs as they did at the companies cited above. </p><p> No amount of knowledge or insight can keep a company ahead if it is not properly distributed where it's needed. Entirely accessible and immensely readable, <i>If Only We Knew What We Know</i> is a much-needed companion for business leaders everywhere.</p></p><p>Responding to the familiar observation that what you don't know can and will hurt you, American Productivity and Quality Center leaders Carla O'Dell and C. Jackson Grayson Jr. have countered with a contention that the "hidden reservoirs of intelligence that exist in almost every organization" can, with work, be efficiently tapped "to create customer value, operational excellence, and product innovation--all the while increasing profits and effectiveness." <i>If Only We Knew What We Know</i> is their detailed examination of the resultant groundbreaking but common-sense methodology they have dubbed "knowledge management," along with their analysis of several companies such as Amoco, Arthur Andersen, Buckman Laboratories, and Xerox that are successfully employing it today. By studying the execution and evolution of this practice in over 70 companies involved with their non-profit management organization, the two have observed how top practitioners are turning internal information that's already selectively available into dynamic improvements that are apparent throughout the companies. They describe how to implement knowledge management in your own firm and describe the "enabling context" (including infrastructure, culture, technology, and measurement) that help or hinder the process. <i>--Howard Rothman</i>Carla O'Dell is president of the American Productivity &amp; Quality Center and director of the Center's International Benchmarking Clearinghouse in Houston, Texas.

His on-the-ground account follows a single platoon through a 15-month tour of duty in the most dangerous outpost in Afghanistan&#39;s Korengal Valley. Through the experiences of these young men at war, he shows what it means to fight, to serve, and to face down mortal danger on a regular basis.</p><p><strong>Evan Thomas and Sebastian Junger: Author One-on-One</strong> <br> In this Amazon exclusive, we brought together authors Sebastian Junger and Evan Thomas and asked them to interview each other. <br> <br> <strong>Evan Thomas</strong> is one of the most respected historians and journalists writing today. He is the author of <em>The War Lovers</em>. <strong>Sebastian Junger</strong> is an internationally acclaimed author and a contributing editor to <i>Vanity Fair</i>, and has been awarded a National Magazine Award and an SAIS Novartis Prize for journalism. He is the author of <em>War</em>. Read on to see Sebastian Junger and Evan Thomas talk about their books.<br> <br> <p></p> <p><b>Evan Thomas</b>: War really is hell in your book. And yet it seems to captivate some of the men who fight it. Why?</p> <p><b>Sebastian Junger</b>: War is hell, as the saying goes--but it isn't only that. It's a lot of other things, too--most of them delivered in forms that are way more pure and intense than what is available back home. The undeniable hellishness of war forces men to bond in ways that aren't necessary--or even possible-- in civilian society. The closest thing to it might be the parent-child bond, but that is not reciprocal. Children are generally not prepared to die for their parents, whereas the men in a platoon of combat infantry for the most part are prepared to do that for each other. For a lot of men, the security of being enclosed by a group like that apparently outweighs the terrors of being in combat. During World War II, wounded soldiers kept going AWOL from the rear-base hospitals in order to rejoin their units on the front line. Clearly, for those men, rejoining their comrades was more important than the risk of death.</p> <p>I'm curious about the reactions of foot soldiers in previous wars--the Civil War, the Spanish-American War. Are there letters from soldiers describing their anguish at being separated from their comrades? Or is this a modern phenomenon? </p> <p><b>Thomas</b>: In the Spanish-American War, Teddy Roosevelt made a cult out of his band of brothers, the Rough Riders, with the twist that he was bringing together gentlemen and cowboys to be true Americans. It was a romantic ideal but largely realized in the short (several week) war they fought--two battles, about a 15 percent casualty rate. The anguish you speak of was felt by the Rough Riders who were left behind--there was no room on the transports for roughly a third of Roosevelt's troopers, and they had to stay behind in Florida. Roosevelt wrote of them weeping over being separated from their comrades and missing out on the fight.</p> <p>Roosevelt's war lust was sated by the Spanish-American War--for a time. He was not a notably bellicose president ("Talk softly but carry a big stick"). But when World War I came, he was almost pathologically driven to get back into the fight. He badgered President Wilson to let him raise a division. (Wilson, not wanting to create a martyr, said no.) Do you think the brotherhood of combat is in some ways addictive? What is it like for the soldiers and marines coming home?</p> <p><b>Junger</b>: It's amazing to see these same themes played out war after war. Politicians seize war for themselves, in some ways, and the public certainly holds them accountable for it--but the men who actually do the fighting are extraordinarily conflicted about it all. Only one man in the platoon I was with chose to leave the army after the deployment--Brendan O'Byrne, a main character in my book and now someone I consider a good friend. A few weeks ago we were hanging out with a family I know, and the talk turned to how rough the fighting was in Afghanistan. The mother, a woman in her thirties, asked Brendan if there was anything he missed about the experience. Brendan looked at her and said, without any irony, "Yes, almost all of it." I think what Brendan meant was that he missed an existence where every detail mattered--whether you tied your shoelaces, whether you cleaned your rifle--and you never had to question the allegiance of your friends. As Brendan said at another point, "There are guys in the platoon who straight-up hate each other-- but they'd all die for each other." Once they've been exposed to that, it's very hard for these guys to go back to a seemingly meaningless and ill-defined civilian life.</p> <p> What happened to the men after they returned from their adventures with Roosevelt? Where did their lives lead them?</p> <p><b>Thomas</b>: The Rough Riders seem to have had endless reunions--but nothing like the PTSD so widely reported today. But perhaps that was because they were only fighting for about a month--a "splendid little war," as diplomat John Hay called it, apparently without irony. In <i>The War Lovers</i>, I was looking at another kind of camaraderie--the bond of men who want to get the country into war, who think that war will somehow restore the nation to spiritual greatness. Roosevelt and his best friend, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, believed that America at the end of the 19th century had become "overcivilized"--that young men were turning soft and needed to somehow stir "the wolf rising in the heart," as Roosevelt put it. "All the great races have been fighting races," he said. It is significant that Roosevelt and Lodge, who pushed America to go to war with Spain in 1898, had written about war a great deal but never seen it. President William McKinley resisted; he had, as he noted, seen "the dead piled up at Antietam" in the Civil War. But the hawks in America were able to roll the doves, not for the last time.</p> <p>Before <i>The War Lovers</i> I wrote <i>Sea of Thunder</i>, a book about the last naval battle of World War II, Leyte Gulf. I interviewed a number of survivors from the USS Johnston, a destroyer sunk in the battle after an unbelievably brave fight against superior forces. About 220 men went in the water but only about half of them were rescued. Because of a series of mistakes by the navy, they were left in the water for two and half days. The sharks came on the first night. For a long time, the survivors did not talk much about it. But then, after Tom Brokaw wrote <i>The Greatest Generation</i>, they began having reunions and speaking--almost compulsively--bout their experiences. The recollections are often harrowing. Yet even years later, when the veterans compiled their recollections in a book of about eighty oral histories, the veterans did not speak of their own fear, with only one exception, as I recall. Somehow acknowledging fear remained a taboo.</p> <p></p> <p>In <i>War</i> you write about fear in clinical and fascinating ways. Did you have a hard time getting men to talk about fear? </p> <p><b>Junger</b>: Getting the men to talk about fear was very hard because, well, I think they were afraid of it. Their biggest worry seemed to be failing the other men of the platoon in some way, and whenever someone got killed, a common reaction was to search their own actions for blame. They didn't want to believe that a good man could get killed for no reason; someone had to be at fault. During combat, their personal fear effectively got subsumed by the greater anxiety that they would fail to do their job and someone else would get killed. The shame of that would last a lifetime, and they would literally do suicidal things to help platoon mates who were in danger. The classic story of a man throwing himself on a hand grenade--certain death, but an action that will almost certainly save everyone else--is neither a Hollywood clich� nor something that only happened in wars gone by. It is something that happens with regularity, and I don't think it can be explained by "army training" or any kind of suicidal impulse. I think that kind of courage goes to the heart of what it means to be human and to affiliate with others in a kind of transcendent way. Of course, once you have experienced a bond like that, everything else looks pathetic and uninteresting. That may be one reason combat vets have such a hard time returning to society..</p> <p>My guess is that the survivors of the USS Johnston were more traumatized by the deaths of their comrades than the prospect of their own death. Did any of them speak to that? What were their nightmares about? Has anyone studied the effect of that trauma on their lives--divorce rate, suicide rate, that kind of thing?</p> <p><b>Thomas</b>: They certainly described the deaths of their colleagues--who went mad from drinking seawater, or were killed by sharks, or died from untreated wounds or exposure (the seawater was about 86 degrees at night, cold if you spent all night immersed in it). Some just swam away and drowned. In one or two cases, men begged to be put out of their misery and were. There were complicated emotions over the deaths. There wasn't enough room on the rafts for all the men, so when one died, it made room for another. I am sure there was terrible guilt, but I didn't get into it with the survivors I interviewed. I don't think they were studied as a cohort. I think they were expected to go on with their lives, and I think by and large they did.</p> <p>Nations are changed by war--but somehow, only for a time. We have a way of forgetting the horrors of war, in the need young men (and old men who missed war) have to some experience the greatest challenge to their manhood. This was true in the period I wrote about in <i>The War Lovers</i>, more than three decades after the Civil War: men like Roosevelt and Lodge wanted to somehow experience the glories of war, and not think too hard about the way wars often turn out in unexpected ways. I know in Cuba, where I visited to research <i>The War Lovers</i>, the Cubans don't think of the Americans as their liberators from Spanish rule, but rather as foreign invaders. That's unfair, and in many ways just plain wrong, but not so hard to understand if you put yourself in the shoes of a country occupied by a foreign army.

Mellon was an anomaly among the great American entrepreneurs of his time. Highly literate and an excellent narrative writer, he was deadly honest about his life, family, and financial success. The book his warning so effectively concealed for almost 110 years was a masterpiece of American autobiography, and it is now available for virtually the first time in this edition.<br>At the time he looked back on his life, Mellon was a successful Pittsburgh entrepreneur and banker. In the next generation, two of his sons, Andrew William Mellon and Richard Beatty Mellon, joined Henry Ford and John D. Rockefeller as the four wealthiest men in the United States, and his descendants would play major roles in American business, art, and philanthropy.<br>Nothing in Thomas Mellon's origins suggested this future. Born in Ulster with a Scotch-Irish heritage, he immigrated to the United States in 1818 at the age of five. He was raised by his parents on a small, hilly farm at Poverty Point, about twenty miles east of Pittsburgh. It seemed that his destiny would be the farm, but in childhood and adolescence he was transformed by two experiences. At the age of ten, he walked to Pittsburgh and saw for the first time the bustle and wealth of this growing city. He was especially awestruck by the mansion and steam mill of the Negley family, "impressed... with an idea of wealth and magnificence I had before no conception of." The thought occurred to this boy whether he "might not one day attain in some degree such wealth, and an equality with such great people." Twenty years later, in 1843, Thomas proposed to Sarah Jane Negley after a courtship that, he observed, took "much valuable time, somewhat to the prejudice of my professional business." They were devoted to each other, and their marriage lasted fifty-five years.<br>The second turning point of his life was a decision he made at the age of seventeen. For years his father, Andrew, had insisted that Thomas become a farmer. One day in 1831, leaving his son cutting timber, Andrew rode to the county seat to close on the purchase of an adjoining farm which he intended for Thomas. "Nearly crazed" by the impending collapse of all hope of "acquiring knowledge and wealth," Thomas threw down his axe and ran ten miles to stop the purchase.<br>From this spontaneous decision flowed his later success as judge, banker, and entrepreneur who caught the exhilarating tide of the American economy in the second half of the nineteenth century. When he died in 1908 at the age of ninety-five, he was an almost mythic figure in American business history. Yet it was the breadth of his reading, his candor, and his gift as a narrative and autobiographical writer that he kept secret from his posterity - until the present.</p><p>&#39;In 1885 Thomas Mellon presented his engrossing autobiography to family members and selected friends with the instructions that it not be for widespread distribution. A delightfully well-written narrative, the book is now published in a second edition for all to read... and extraordinary treasure.&#39;ChoiceA vastly engrossing 19th-century rags-to-riches autobiography by the somewhat priggish, but shrewd and observant, founder of the Mellon family fortune. Thomas Mellon (18131908) wrote this 1885 memoir solely as a ``memento of affection'' for his descendants, anticipating ``that it will not be for sale in bookstores, nor any new edition published.'' Mellon was born in Ireland to farmers of modest means who emigrated to Poverty Point, near Pittsburgh, when he was five years old. He recounts a happy, if Spartan, upbringing there on his father's farm. A visit to Pittsburgh impressed the nine-year-old Mellon with the magnificence of the city, and at the age of 17, deciding against farming in favor of getting an education, Mellon suddenly stopped his father from purchasing a farm for him. Interspersing college attendance with teaching and farm chores, Mellon attended Western University in Pittsburgh, read law with a prominent Pittsburgh attorney, and became a member of the bar in 1838. He married in 1843 and had eight children; became an eminent lawyer and judge and a successful investor; and founded a predecessor of the Mellon Bank in 1870. Mellon's narrative of his happy family life and prominent, though not terribly eventful, career forms the backdrop for a wide variety of opinions and observations, sage and otherwise: on the importance of marrying for discretion rather than love; on the heavy responsibilities of a judge; on the Great Panic of 1873; on the declining work ethic and increased crime rate Mellon saw around him in newly industrialized America; and on the (not always positive) transformative effects of new inventions created in his lifetime. A charming memoir with some surprisingly meditative reflections, by an entrepreneurial leader of the time, on the bewildering changes wrought by 19th-century industrialism.

Wittenberg has written a comprehensive sudy of the critical actions on Brinkerhoff&#39;s Ridge and East Cavalry Field, fought on July 2 and 3, 1863. In these actions, Union Brig. Gen. David M. Gregg&#39;s Second Cavalry Division fought two protracted and important actions along the Union right flank. The fight for Brinkerhoff&#39;s Ridge, although relatively small in numbers, prevented the legendary Stonewall Brigade from participating in the Confederate assaults on Culp&#39;s Hill, perhaps tipping the balance in the struggle for the hill. Wittenberg presents a new and controversial theory for why Maj. Gen. JEB Stuart&#39;s Confederate cavalry appeared on Cress Ridge on East Cavalry Field on the afternoon of July 3, 1863. After a long and bloody dismounted fight, Brig. Gen. George Armstrong Custer&#39;s Michigan Cavalry Brigade helped to repulse a massed mounted charge by three brigades of Southern horsemen, securing the Union right flank, and helping to clinch the Northern victory at Gettysburg. Wittenberg weaves the stories of soldiers together with a keen understanding of the terrain and presents a compelling story that features six fine maps by John C. Heiser and forty illustrations. The book also includes a driving tour guide of the Brinkerhoff&#39;s Ridge and East Cavalry Field battlefields that includes an additional twenty photographs of modern-day views of these sites. This book is a must for all Gettysburg and cavalry buffs. Volume One of the Discovering Civil War America series.</p><p>Eric J. Wittenberg is an accomplished American Civil War cavalry historian and author. An attorney in Ohio, Wittenberg has authored over 21 books on various Civil War subjects, with particular focus on cavalry operations, as well as three dozen articles in popular magazines such as North &amp; South, Blue&amp;Gray, America&#x2019;s Civil War, and Gettysburg Magazine. His first book, Gettysburg&#x2019;s Forgotten Cavalry Actions (Thomas Publications, Gettysburg PA, 1998) won the prestigious 1998 Bachelder-Coddington Literary Award.

Reprint.</p><p>Nick Morrelli is the Platte City, Nebraska, sheriff who must be smarter than he appears, since there's a framed Harvard law degree hanging on his wall. Not that appearances don't count. The reader is treated to a number of descriptions of his sexy, lady-killer looks and his charismatic effect on even the most hard-bitten woman character in this somewhat muddled, serial-killer thriller. Nick is investigating the kidnap-murders of two young Platte City boys when FBI profiler Maggie O'Dell shows up and all but takes over the investigation. Several years earlier, the former sheriff--Nick's father--capped his own career with the arrest of the last serial killer in the neighborhood, who abducted and tortured three boys in an eerily similar crime spree. When Antonio Morrelli returns from retirement to meddle in the investigation, and when Nick's own sister uses her connections to advance his career, Nick hardly raises an objection. And that's the central weakness of what would otherwise be a good, first effort. <i>--Jane Adams</i><b>Alex Kava</b> grew up in rural Nebraska, outside the small town of Silver Creek (pop. 500).

One of the last of his seventy books, The Revolution of the Dialectic is a sweeping, penetrating look into our mind and the psychological states that make us suffer. It is also perhaps his most practical and useful book, for here we are given a masterful explanation of the precise, ancient method to eliminate suffering and revolutionize our lives. His practical and clear synthesis of the universal psychological teachings found in ancient religions and esoteric traditions gives the means by which we can grow and develop psychologically and spiritually. Moment to moment watchfulness of oneself (self-observation) in combination with revolutionary meditation techniques leads to the awakening the consciousness, the emergence of genuine happiness, and the restoration of a humane and just society.</p><p>The name Samael Aun Weor is Hebrew and is pronounced sam-ayel on vay-ohr. Samael Aun Weor wrote over sixty books, gave thousands of lectures, and formed the worldwide Gnostic Movement, whose members number in the millions. And yet, in spite of his wisdom and generosity towards mankind, he said: &#34;Do not follow me. I am just a signpost. Reach your own Self-realization.&#34; His lifelong mission was to deliver to humanity the total and exact science to develop the complete human being, that mysterious and ancient wisdom long hidden in the bosom of every great religion.Society is the extension of the individual. If the individual is covetous, cruel, pitiless, egotistical, etc., then the society will be likewise. It is necessary to be sincere with oneself. Each one of us is a degenerate; therefore, our society inevitably has to be degenerated. This cannot be resolved by the terrible monster of materialism. This can only be resolved by the individual on the basis of his Integral Revolution. The hour to reflect on our own destiny has arrived. Violence does not resolve anything. Violence can only lead us to failure. We need peace, serenity, reflection, comprehension. The problem of the world is the problem of the individual. Bloody revolutions do not resolve anything. The problem of having the consciousness bottled up can only be resolved by means of Intelligence. Only by means of Intelligence is it possible for us to convert the intellectual animal first into a Man and afterwards into a Superman. Only by means of the Revolution of the Dialectic is it possible for us to overcome the terrible monster of materialism. The human society is the extension of the individual. Therefore, if we really want a radical change, if we want a better world, we need to then change individually. We need to change within ourselves; we need to alter within our own individuality the abominable factors which produce misery and pain in the world. Let us remember that the human-mass is the sum of the individuals. If each individual changes, then the human-mass will inevitably change.</p><h2>Strength and Glory (Shadowcreek Chronicles)</h2><p>The fall of 1864 finds Colonel John S.

The kindly gentleman remarks, ``You must be answering my ad,'' and shows him around: mailroom (Cub's not eligible for a job here--he knows only one language), workshop (``every kind of toy in the world,'' but it's a benign lot compared to most stores), ``the North Pole itself'' (a fantastic electric generator), testing room, wrapping room, etc. Tour complete, Santa admits that he always knew Cub's parents would want him back and takes him home with a special present--this book. It's familiar territory, but elaborated with unusual good humor and imagination; kids are sure to enjoy the multitudinous, brightly colored details on the large, square pages bordered with shiny stars. An inviting book that satisfies to the end, when Cub curls up cozily with his parents and his new treasure. (Picture book. 4-8) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Ages 4-7. The art's the thing here, and there's so much to see that children will want to pore over this before and after Christmas. The hook on which the story hangs is the tumble of a curious polar bear right through a hole in the snow into Santa's study. Santa takes Cub on a tour of the property, and this is what readers will enjoy. The panoramic two-page spreads and individual panels begin at the top of the world and continue through the workshops, into the kitchen and the wrapping room (where long, colorful sheets of paper hang from the ceiling), and off to the barn. Best of all is the toy storage room. Dolls, bears, trucks, tops, robots--of every conceivable shape and size--fill the gigantic space. Talk about a kid in a candy store! Readers can plan their Christmas gifts 10 times over. There's no real story to speak of, and in the end, not surprisingly, Cub gets a ride home in the sleigh. But this is a delight to look at, like a Christmas tree sparkling with lights. <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p><h2>The toymaker&#39;s book of wooden vehicles</h2><p>Instructions for making wooden toys.</p><p></p><h2>Dupe</h2><p>The 1980 John Creasy Award winner.

We consider it a national liability and fear our children will be forced to pay for our current excesses. John Steele Gordon is a welcome antidote. In 1997, his book, Hamilton's Blessing, offered a "biography" of the debt, making it very much a human drama while explaining the myriad, mostly positive, ways it has influenced America's history since Alexander Hamilton first proposed the virtues of a national debt in 1792. </p><p>However, the 12 years since the book's initial publication have been perhaps the most dramatic in the debt's history-since it has more than doubled and continues on an ever-upward spiral. Now, more than ever, we need John Steele Gordon's wisdom-his revised and expanded edition of Hamilton's Blessing will put this historic expansion in perspective, allowing us to better participate in debate and discussion. </p><p>Bringing a remarkable national institution to life, Gordon offers, in the process, an original view of American history, and insight into both well- and lesser-known figures who have influenced and charted our voyage, from Hamilton to Jay Cooke to John Maynard Keynes to the present. The national debt helped rescue the Union during the Civil War and raise the nation out of the Depression-thus offering hope it may serve a similar purpose in the decades to come.</p></p><p><p>John Steele Gordon is one of America's leading historians, specializing in business and financial history.

Passed through, negotiated, unnamed, unacknowledged: the edgelands - those familiar yet ignored spaces which are neither city nor countryside - have become the great wild places on our doorsteps. In the same way the Romantic writers taught us to look at hills, lakes and rivers, poets Paul Farley and Michael Symmons Roberts write about mobile masts and gravel pits, business parks and landfill sites, taking the reader on a journey to marvel at these richly mysterious, forgotten regions in our midst. &#34;Edgelands&#34; forms a critique of what we value as &#39;wild&#39;, and allows our allotments, railways, motorways, wasteland and water a presence in the world, and a strange beauty all of their own.</p><p>Michael Symmons Roberts (Author) Michael Symmons Roberts was born in Preston, Lancashire in 1963.

Sawyer. An alien shuttle craft lands outside the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. A six-legged, two-armed alien emerges, who says, in perfect English, "Take me to a paleontologist." <br>It seems that Earth, and the alien's home planet, and the home planet of another alien species traveling on the alien mother ship, all experienced the same five cataclysmic events at about the same time (one example of these "cataclysmic events" would be the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs). Both alien races believe this proves the existence of God: i.e. he's obviously been playing with the evolution of life on each of these planets.<br><br>From this provocative launch point, Sawyer tells a fast-paced, and morally and intellectually challenging, SF story that just grows larger and larger in scope. The evidence of God's universal existence is not universally well received on Earth, nor even immediately believed. And it reveals nothing of God's nature. In fact. it poses more questions than it answers.<br><br>When a supernova explodes out in the galaxy but close enough to wipe out life on all three home-worlds, the big question is, Will God intervene or is this the sixth cataclysm:?<br><br><i>Calculating God</i> is SF on the grand scale.&nbsp;<i>Calculating God</i> is a 2001 Hugo Award Nominee for Best Novel.<br></p><p>Creationists rarely find sympathy in the ranks of science fiction authors--or fans, for that matter. And while Robert J. Sawyer doesn't exactly make peace with evangelicals on the issue, <i>Calculating God</i> has to be one of the more thoughtful and sympathetic SF portrayals you'll find of religion and intelligent design. But that should come as no surprise from this crafty Canadian: in the Nebula Award-winning <i>Terminal Experiment</i>, Sawyer speculated on what would happen if hard evidence were ever found for the human soul; in <i>Calculating God</i>, he turns science on its head again when earth is invaded by theists from outer space.<p> The book starts out like the setup for some punny science fiction joke: An alien walks into a museum and asks if he can see a paleontologist. But the arachnid ET hasn't come aboard a rowboat with the Pope and Stephen Hawking (although His Holiness does request an audience later). Landing at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, the spacefarer (named Hollus) asks to compare notes on mass extinctions with resident dino-scientist Thomas Jericho. A shocked Jericho finds that not only does life exist on other planets, but that every civilization in the galaxy has experienced extinction events at precisely the same time. Armed with that disconcerting information (and a little help from a grand unifying theory), the alien informs Jericho, almost dismissively, that "the primary goal of modern science is to discover why God has behaved as he has and to determine his methods."</p><p> Inventive, fast-paced, and alternately funny and touching, <i>Calculating God</i> sneaks in a well-researched survey of evolution science, exobiology, and philosophy amidst the banter between Hollus and Jericho. But the book also proves to be very moving and character-driven SF, as Jericho--in the face of Hollus's convincing arguments--grapples with his own bitter reasons for not believing in God. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Robert J.

Numbered air forces were composed of &#x201c;commands,&#x201d; defined by function and typically designated with a Roman numeral that was the same number as that of the air force. The Eighth was composed of the VIII Bomber Command and the VIII Fighter Command&#x2014;long-range heavy bombers and the fighters to escort them&#x2014;as well as the VIII Air Force Base Command to manage its base infrastructure. The VIII Air Support Command was added to operate medium bombers in a tactical role, but was later peeled off to form the nucleus of the Ninth Air Force.</p><p>Within the USAAF table of organization, the &#x201c;group&#x201d; was the basic building block, and was contained within the commands. Groups initially contained three squadrons, although larger organizations, such as the Eighth Air Force, later added a fourth squadron to many groups. As the numbers of groups increased in 1943&#x2013;1944, &#x201c;wings&#x201d; were activated to contain multiple groups, and &#x201c;divisions&#x201d; were later activated to contain multiple wings. Both wings and divisions were technically contained within commands, although, beginning in 1944, those within the Eighth Air Force answered directly to the Eighth Air Force headquarters.</p><p></p><p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>The Eighth Air Force is not the subject of this book but the stage upon which the climactic act of eight stories takes place. It was the wartime home of these eight individuals, whose lives intersected beneath its roof.</p><p>These are eight parallel lives chosen from among those of around 350,000 men who were part of this unique organization during a crossroads of world history. These eight came from widely varied backgrounds, in a dozen states, from North Carolina to Alaska (then a territory).</p><p>Tooey Spaatz, Ira Eaker, and Jimmy Doolittle each served as commander of the Eighth Air Force during World War II, but their careers were much more than their time with the Eighth. Their aviation careers were closely intertwined with one another and with the early evolution of American aviation and American airpower.</p><p>Curtis LeMay and Hub Zemke were also accomplished prewar military pilots, and they became important leaders in the middle tier of command at the Eighth. With LeMay commanding bomber units and Zemke commanding fighters, both led large numbers of men, but both also flew combat missions themselves.</p><p>Maynard &#x201c;Snuffy&#x201d; Smith, an anomaly among the eight, was the only enlisted man. He was the first living airman in the European Theater to receive the Medal of Honor, but his medal was a shining island in a lifetime of mischief and failure. Recalling Smith&#x2019;s life is like looking at a train wreck. Though it is unsettling to watch, we cannot avert our eyes. Yet he is an icon of the Eighth who is not forgotten, and who symbolizes how service with the Eighth brought out the very best in even the most unlikely people.</p><p>Bob Morgan piloted the <i>Memphis Belle</i>, probably the best remembered of the tens of thousands of B-17 Flying Fortresses that were operated by the Eighth&#x2014;and he later served under LeMay in the Pacific. Just as Doolittle led the <i>first</i> American raid on Tokyo in 1942, Morgan led the <i>next</i> mission to Tokyo in 1944.</p><p>Rosie Rosenthal flew Flying Fortresses with the 100th Bomb Group, known as the &#x201c;Bloody Hundredth&#x201d; for the terribly heavy losses that it suffered in combat. On his third mission with the Bloody Hundredth, Rosenthal was the only member of the group on that mission who came back. He interrupted his career as an attorney to fly with the Eighth, and then returned to Germany after the war as part of the prosecution team at Nuremberg.</p><p>Though the Eighth Air Force was only one of 16 numbered air forces within the US Army Air Forces (USAAF) during World War II, it was the largest, and today it is probably the most famous. At the National Museum of the Mighty Eighth Air Force in Pooler, Georgia, we are reminded that the Eighth suffered half the casualties of the entire USAAF during World War II.</p><p>These eight lives are representative of those of more than a third of a million men who rose to a challenge and helped wield the relentless hammer that pounded the Third Reich into submission, earning an indelible place in the annals of world history for the Eighth Air Force.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>Three of the eight were born on the cusp of two centuries, in which the paradigms that had defined the nineteenth were recognized to have expired but the defining characteristics of the twentieth were not yet known. These men, who were born when manned, powered flight was still a pipe dream, would be among the shapers of twentieth-century military aviation.</p><p>Carl Andrew Spatz came into the world on June 28, 1891, in the southeastern Pennsylvania community of Boyertown, a village of 1,436 people by the reckoning of the previous year&#x2019;s national census. A second-generation American of German extraction, he was the eldest son and second child of Anne Muntz Spatz and her husband of two years, Charles Spatz, a politically active newspaperman whose own parents, Karl and Juliana Amalie Busch Spatz, had emigrated from Prussia in 1865. Karl was an accomplished commercial printer fluent in several languages; Juliana was related to the Krupp family, the powerful German industrialists.</p><p>Later in the coming century, a second &#x201c;a&#x201d; was added to the surname to give it a &#x201c;Dutch&#x201d; appearance. According to David Mets, Carl Andrew&#x2019;s biographer, the second &#x201c;a&#x201d; was also intended to encourage the correct pronunciation of the surname (&#x201c;spots&#x201d;) rather than &#x201c;spats,&#x201d; which was synonymous with the pretentious and outmoded footwear accessory.</p><p>Karl bought the <i>Boyertown Democrat</i> newspaper, running it until his death in 1884, after which it was taken over by Charles, then only 19 years old. By 1891, when young Carl Andrew was born, the paper was still going strong and Charles was gaining influence in the Boyertown community.</p><p>On the editorial page, Charles expressed a sentiment for an expansionist foreign policy, such as the intervention in Cuba on behalf of its independence from Spain. Today, small-town papers usually restrict themselves to local news, but in those days&#x2014;before cable news networks or even radio&#x2014;people got all their world news and journalistic opinion from newspapers.</p><p>In 1896, Charles Spatz was elected to the state assembly, and young Carl Andrew joined him in Harrisburg as a page before joining the staff of the paper, now called the <i>Berks County Democrat</i>, where he was described as the youngest Linotype operator in the state.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Ira Clarence Eaker and James Harold Doolittle were both born in 1896, a year in which hints of the transition to a new age in the coming century were seen and discussed. It was the year that Henry Ford first putted down a Michigan lane in his gasoline-powered &#x201c;Quadricycle,&#x201d; though no one but Ford himself&#x2014;and perhaps not even him&#x2014;grasped the importance of this turn of events. In Dayton, Ohio, Wilbur and Orville Wright were imagining technology that was even further from the imagination of the average person than that which Ford was exploring.</p><p>Eaker was born on April 13, 1896, in Field Creek in Llano County, Texas, about 100 miles north of San Antonio, near the Old Chisholm Trail. Doolittle was born eight months later, on December 14, at the western edge of the continent in Alameda, California, a Navy town within sight of San Francisco.</p><p>Field Creek, where the post office was closed in 1976, still doesn&#x2019;t appear on most maps. Ira was the eldest of the five sons of a farmhand and part-time cowboy named Young Yancy &#x201c;Y.Y.&#x201d; Eaker and his wife, Dona Lee Graham Eaker, who was only 17 when Ira was born. As Eaker later told Colonel Joe Green of the US Military History Institute, the family was &#x201c;poor by any modern standard, but we didn&#x2019;t know it. We were comfortable and had plenty of food and we considered that our status enabled us to move forward and encouraged us to do so.&#x201d;</p><p>The family, originally called Ecker, had emigrated from the Pfalz (Palatine) region in what is now southwestern Germany in the early eighteenth century. They originally settled in upstate New York, but later generations drifted west. Ira&#x2019;s grandfather William Eaker came to Eden in Concho County, Texas, after the Civil War. Y. Y. Eaker was born there two years before his father died in 1874 at the age of 60. Ira&#x2019;s father moved the family back to Eden&#x2014;named for Fred Ede, not for the biblical garden&#x2014;and bought a farm near the town when the eldest son was nine.</p><p>Schooling was important for <i>all</i> the Eaker children&#x2014;Dona&#x2019;s father was on the school board&#x2014;but Ira&#x2019;s mother always felt that he was the smartest one of her brood and urged him to set his sights beyond the horizon as viewed from Eden. Church was also an important part of the family routine, and as a small boy Ira had once aspired to be an apostle&#x2014;until he was told that their ranks had been closed after the first 12. &#x201c;I went to church enough before I was ten to do me the rest of my life,&#x201d; he later told his biographer, James Parton.</p><p>Ira grew up, like most boys, reading adventure stories, but an exciting reality that other boys only read about in stories was not far from his door. &#x201c;My earliest heroes were cowboys and Indians,&#x201d; Ira later recalled. &#x201c;I grew up with them. Cowboys taught me to play poker.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Jimmy Doolittle was the son of a carpenter who had left Massachusetts for California to seek his fortune. Having sailed around Cape Horn to reach the Golden State, Frank Henry Doolittle settled in Alameda. It was here that he met and married Rosa Ceremah Shepherd, and where they had their only child, a little boy. On his birth certificate, he was called simply &#x201c;Doolittle.&#x201d; He was never to know why he was not named until later, nor why they eventually named him James Harold. He knew only that he hated his middle name.</p><p>Frank and Rosa might have remained in Alameda or thereabouts permanently, but 1896 was the year of the Klondike Gold Rush. Gold was discovered in Canada&#x2019;s Yukon Territory in August of that year, and news soon reached Seattle and San Francisco that a man could gather up nuggets the size of a robin&#x2019;s egg by the handful. A few hardy souls headed north immediately, despite the onset of winter in a harsh environment that most could not have anticipated. After the &#x201c;Rush&#x201d; of 1896 and the spring thaw of 1897, there came what was to be called the Klondike &#x201c;Stampede.&#x201d;</p><p>Frank Doolittle was among the thousands who stampeded northward. He was one of many who arrived after the easy pickings had been picked, but he found his carpentry skills in high demand in boomtowns such as Dawson. His gold came in a manner that he had not expected, but in a manner more reliable than staking his fate on flecks in a gold pan. While Frank was up north, young Jimmy Doolittle spent his first three birthdays back in California without a father.</p><p>Meanwhile, stories told of golden sand along the shores of the Bering Sea fired another gold rush. In 1899, Frank Doolittle reached Nome, a little village that quickly became Alaska&#x2019;s largest city, and in June 1900 he sent for his family. Rosa, Jimmy, and Rosa&#x2019;s sister, Sarah, were among 25,000 who arrived that summer.</p><p>As he had in the Klondike, Frank Doolittle returned to carpentry. Among other things, he built a comfortable home for his family. On the plains of Texas and Oklahoma, Ira Eaker&#x2019;s family did not have electricity in their home until he was in his teens. In Nome, Jimmy Doolittle&#x2019;s family had electricity before he started to school.</p><p>Once in school, Jimmy found himself the shortest in his class, and discovered that size put him at a disadvantage. &#x201c;A few of the taller boys took delight in teasing and provoking the shorter boys, and since I was the shortest one around, they tried to give me a bad time,&#x201d; he wrote in his memoirs. &#x201c;They shoved and I shoved back. They punched and I returned their punches.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Since my size was against me, I decided my survival could be insured only by a speedy attack right from the start. I began to blast my opponents with a flurry of punches regardless of the consequences. The tactics worked. I found it was easy to draw blood if you were nimble on your feet, aimed at a fellow&#x2019;s nose, and got your licks in early. After several antagonists went home with bloody noses, I earned a certain measure of respect.&#x201d;</p><p>Though Frank rarely engaged in conversation with his son and remained distant and aloof, he did teach the boy how to work with tools. Jimmy wrote in his memoirs that he longed for a closer relationship with his loner father, but it never happened. In his recollections, the defining moment in their relationship came when Frank falsely accused Jimmy of lying&#x2014;and then beat him up. The skinny little boy promised that one day he would do the same to his father, and Frank Doolittle just laughed.</p><p>Jimmy might have grown to manhood in Alaska, hunting and fishing and perhaps pursuing his father&#x2019;s trade, but in the late summer of 1908, as he was nearing his twelfth birthday, his mother decided to leave Frank, and Alaska, permanently. Taking Jimmy, she sailed for Los Angeles, where she had relatives, and where she would spend the rest of her life. Jimmy wrote in his memoirs that he assumed he would see his father again soon. It would be six years.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>In 1906, Carl Andrew Spaatz (we&#x2019;ll use the later double-&#x201c;a&#x201d; spelling for the sake of consistency) enrolled in the college prep Perkiomen School in Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, but when his father was injured in a fire in 1908, Carl was called home to run the family newspaper. By the time Charles recovered, the family&#x2019;s finances were stretched thin. Despite his local prominence, Charles had never become a wealthy man. Being a big fish in a 1,436-person pond had its limitations, as did the circulation of such a pond&#x2019;s leading newspaper. The family, which had come to include five children&#x2014;plus Charles&#x2019;s mother&#x2014;lived in the same building that contained the newspaper offices and the pressroom.</p><p>The family had always imagined higher education for Carl, though, as times were hard, this now seemed further and further from their grasp financially. Though the US Military Academy at West Point&#x2014;like its naval counterpart in Annapolis&#x2014;offered free education, it was considered as a higher education option even by families with no military pedigree, so competition was fierce, and it was extremely hard to gain admission.</p><p>Somehow, though, Carl got into West Point. David Mets notes that Charles was an acquaintance of Major Thomas Rhoads, personal physician to President William Howard Taft, and that it was he who made the suggestion and facilitated the appointment. However, a June 3, 1982, article in the <i>Boyertown Area Times</i> (a descendant of Charles&#x2019;s newspaper, but no longer family owned) suggests that Congressman John Hoover Rothermel made a congressional appointment in exchange for Charles Spatz&#x2019;s not running against him for Congress.</p><p>As with many men who went on to significant military careers, Carl Andrew Spaatz&#x2019;s time at West Point was undistinguished academically and marred by fr...</p></p><h2>Heron's Cove (A Sharpe &amp; Donovan Novel)</h2><p><b>WHEN YOUR SAFETY DEPENDS ON LIVING A LIE...&nbsp;</b><br><br>After escaping certain death, FBI deep-cover agent Colin Donovan is back home on the Maine coast with his new love, FBI art crimes expert Emma Sharpe.

"Intense," she said, managing not to slam the tulip-shaped nosing glass on the table and grab the pitcher of water. <em>Give it a few seconds.</em> She was an FBI agent, after all. Tough as nails. She smiled at the four men. "People pay to drink this one, huh?"<br><br>"Dearly," Finian Bracken, the Irish priest, said. "You're not one for a heavily peated whiskey, I see."<br><br>Emma tried to distinguish the other flavors of the sample&#x2014;spices, fruits, whatever&#x2014;but only tasted the peat. "I don't know if I'm one for a lightly peated whiskey, either."<br><br>A cold wind penetrated Hurley's thin walls and sprayed the old windows with salt water and rain. The restaurant, a fixture on the Rock Point harbor, was basically a shack that jutted out over the water. Now only a few lights penetrated the dark night and fog. Finian had organized the impromptu tasting, setting up on a back table away from what few diners were there on a windy, rainy late-October Friday. He and Michael, Andy and Kevin Donovan were already gathered over a half-dozen bottles of highend whiskey when Emma had arrived in southern Maine an hour ago, up from Boston and her job with a small, specialized FBI unit.<br><br>Only Colin, the second-born Donovan, wasn't in Rock Point. Mike was a Maine guide, Andy a lobster-man and Kevin a state marine patrol officer, but, like Emma, Colin was an FBI agent.<br><br><em>Not like me,</em> she thought.<br><br>She specialized in art crimes. Colin was a deep-cover agent. He'd left his hometown a month ago, pretending to return to FBI headquarters in Washington. The true nature of his work was known to only a few even within the FBI, but his brothers had guessed that he didn't sit at a desk. Initially he'd kept in touch at least intermittently with his family and friends&#x2014;and Emma&#x2014;but for the past three weeks, no one had heard from him.<br><br>The silence was far too long, not just for his family and friends but for the FBI. And for Emma.<br><br>She felt the draft at her feet. She had come prepared for the conditions, dressed in jeans, black merino wool sweater, raincoat, wool socks and Frye boots. The Donovans were in a mix of flannel, canvas and denim, no sign they even noticed the cold and the damp. Finian had opted against his usual black suit and Roman collar and instead wore a dark gray Irish-knit sweater and black corduroy trousers. He was a sharp-featured, handsome Irishman in his late thirties who had arrived in the small Maine fishing village in June. He had run into Colin, home for a few days in the midst of a difficult, dangerous mission, and they quickly became unexpected friends.<br><br>Emma hadn't met Colin until September. She suspected his friendship with the Irish priest was less of a mystery to her than to his brothers. Finian Bracken was a fish out of water in Rock Point. He had no history with the town and little familiarity with the FBI. He also had a ready Irish wit, and he knew whiskey. He was objective, intelligent, tolerant&#x2014;a safe friend for a federal agent with secrets.<br><br>Andy Donovan held his small glass to the light and examined the Scotch's deep caramel color, then swirled it and brought it to his nose. He raised his eyes&#x2014;the same shade of gray as Colin's&#x2014;to Finian. "Do you want me to tell you what I smell?"<br><br>"If you like," Finian said. "Just sniff. Don't inhale deeply. It's not a yoga class."<br><br>"As if you'd ever find one of us in a yoga class," Andy said, then shrugged. "It smells like peat."<br><br>Finian observed him with interest. "What else? Do you smell spices, fruit&#x2014;chocolate, maybe?"<br><br>"Nope. It smells like an expensive Scotch to me."<br><br>"Have a taste, then," the priest said with a sigh, his Irish Kerry accent more pronounced than usual.<br><br>"No problem." Andy tossed back the Scotch and made a face. "I'm with Emma. Too smoky for me."<br><br>It was the final whiskey of the evening. The Donovan brothers hadn't left so much as a drop in any of the specially designed glasses, one for each whiskey.<br><br>The glasses all had little hats, like Scottish tams, that concentrated the aromas of each sample. Finian had brought them from the rectory; Hurley's didn't have whiskey nosing glasses. Before turning to the priesthood six years ago, Finian and his twin brother, Declan, had founded and operated Bracken Distillers on the southwest Irish coast. Bracken 15 year old, an award-winning single malt and rare peated Irish whiskey, was one of the night's offerings&#x2014;or "expressions," as Finian called his lineup of bottles.<br><br>Emma noticed Mike, the eldest Donovan, eyeing her from across the round table. He was down from the remote Bold Coast where he worked as an independent wilderness guide. "Special Agent Sharpe's a wine drinker. Aren't you, Emma?"<br><br>She couldn't detect any hint of criticism or sarcasm in his tone, but he still was looking at her as if she had done something wrong. "I like wine." She kept any de-fensiveness out of her voice. "How about you, Mike? Do you pack a nice Central Coast red in your canoe when you take tourists on moose-sighting excursions?"<br><br>Kevin and Andy both grinned. Mike ignored them and settled back in his chair. "I took a couple out on the river in August. They had a wicker picnic hamper stocked with real wineglasses, cloth napkins, silver cutlery, French cheese, a baguette, apples and pears and two bottles of fancy wine."<br><br>"Must have weighed down the canoe," Kevin, the marine patrol officer, said.<br><br>"Oh, yeah. They insisted on having a picnic on the riverbank but they didn't count on Maine mosquitoes. They lasted three minutes before we had to throw everything back in the canoe. We paddled straight back to their car."<br><br>"Don't tell me," Andy said, amused. "The next stop on their Maine tour was Heron's Cove."<br><br>"Couldn't wait to get there. I'm sure they enjoyed the quaint shops and fancy restaurants."<br><br>"Everyone does," Emma said.<br><br>"I don't care." Mike raised his as-yet untouched glass of the heavily peated Scotch; his eyes were lighter than those of his three younger brothers but no less intense. <em>"Sldinte."</em><br><br>Finian winked at Emma but said nothing. She reached for the Inish Turk Beg, a clear, triple-distilled whiskey from an independent distillery on a small island off the west coast of Ireland. She splashed a little into a fresh glass, set down the distinctive tilted bottle, then held up her glass to Mike. <em>"Sldinte."</em><br><br>He swallowed the Scotch and she sipped the Inish Turk Beg, one of Finian's favorites. He had explained that it was gentle on the palate, clean and fresh on the nose, with fruity aromas, flavors of apple and orange zest and a dry finish. Emma wasn't discriminating enough to go much beyond whether she could get a taste down with or without choking.<br><br>"Colin would have enjoyed tonight," said his eldest brother, still watching her.<br><br>Emma nodded. "He'll have that chance soon. Lots of whiskey left."<br><br>"Are you and your FBI friends any closer to finding him?"<br><br>"You're assuming he's missing&#x2014;"<br><br>"That's right. I am."<br><br>Her head spun and she wished she had skipped the extra taste of the Inish Turk Beg. "I can't discuss your brother's work with you."<br><br>Andy and Kevin were as serious now as Mike was. Even Kevin, a law enforcement officer himself, didn't have any information on his older brother's work as one of the FBI's most valuable ghosts. Emma had only a few details on his latest mission herself. It wasn't as if Colin couldn't handle himself in a dangerous situation. He was bold, aggressive and tough.<br><br>He was also sexy, she thought.<br><br>Incredibly sexy, in fact.<br><br>She kept that assessment to herself. "I'm sorry. I don't know why Colin hasn't been in touch."<br><br>"He's not a desk jockey in Washington." Mike got up abruptly, grabbed his jacket off the back of his chair. "You don't have to confirm or deny. We all know. He's always stuck his nose in dangerous situations. Even as kids, he'd be the one jumping into cold water and waves, chasing sharks. It's his way."<br><br>"I understand that," Emma said.<br><br>"Is it your way, Emma?"<br><br>She didn't respond at once. Aware of the four men watching her, she picked up one of the tiny tam-style hats and set it atop a glass. "Maybe Colin and I have more in common than you realize."<br><br>"You're a Sharpe," Mike said. "You were a nun."<br><br>"A novice. I never made my final vows." Emma kept her voice even, neutral. "I studied art history and art conservation during my time with the sisters. I come from a family of art detectives. That background helps in my work with the FBI."<br><br>Mike shrugged on his jacket. "I just think you have a knack for attracting trouble."<br><br>"And you're worried about your brother."<br><br>"Maybe I'm worried about you, too."<br><br>She let his comment slide. She had already said too much. "When do you go home?"<br><br>He grinned. "Not soon enough for you, I expect." The seriousness returned to his eyes as he looked down at her. "If you hear from Colin, you'll let us know, okay?"<br><br>It was more of an order than a request but Emma nodded. "I will, Mike."<br><br>He leaned over and kissed her on the cheek. "Take care of yourself." He shifted his gaze to Finian. "Thanks for the whiskey and the whiskey education, Father. <em>Uisce beatha.</em> 'The water of life.' I like that."<br><br>"We'll do it again when Colin's in town," Finian said.<br><br>"Yeah. We will." The eldest Donovan grinned suddenly. "I think I tasted chocolate in that last Scotch."<br><br>Kevin and Andy thanked Finian and said good-night to him and to Emma as they followed Mike out of the nearly empty restaurant. The late-October weather wouldn't faze them. They would take whatever weather northern New England threw at them in stride. Rain, snow, sleet, fog, wind. Wouldn't matter.<br><br>Once the brothers disappeared through the outer door, Finian sighed as he corked the Inish Turk Beg. "If you had information that could ease their worry, Emma, would you give it to them? Could you?"<br><br>"If I'd heard from Colin, I'd have said so."<br><br>"His story of an intense schedule in Washington has worn thin. I assume the FBI will be in touch with his family if need be."<br><br>Emma felt the whiskey burning in her throat. "The safety of an agent&#x2014;any agent&#x2014;is of paramount importance to the FBI. Colin's brothers know that."<br><br>"But you don't know where he is, do you?"<br><br>The look he gave her told her she didn't need to answer.<br><br>A strong gust of wind whistled, whipped more rain against the windows. The small, protected working harbor was lost in the dense, swirling fog. In September, Emma had gone on a boat ride with Colin, kayaked with him, picked apples with him. Laughed, made love. They had met over the horrific murder of a nun at the Sisters of the Joyful Heart, Emma's former convent. Until then, she hadn't realized another FBI agent had grown up just a few miles from her own home in Heron's Cove. They'd had a short time together before Colin was gone again, chasing illegal arms merchants.<br><br>He had the FBI behind him but, ultimately, he was alone. Emma understood he could go dark, but not like this. Not with no word for weeks.<br><br>His Irish friend's midnight eyes narrowed on her. "Colin's in trouble, isn't he, Emma? It's all right. You don't have to answer. I watched you tonight. I could see the answer for myself."<br><br>"He's independent."<br><br>"He's good at working alone. All the Donovans are." She watched raindrops slide down the window. "Do you ever feel alone here?"<br><br>"I'm here for a reason. I have a purpose."<br><br>She glanced back at Finian. "That doesn't answer the question, does it?"<br><br>"It does for me."<br><br>She thought she understood what he meant. After the deaths of his wife and their two young daughters in a sailing accident, he had walked away from Bracken Distillers to enter the priesthood and follow his calling wherever it took him. In June, he had landed in Rock Point to serve struggling St. Patrick's parish while its priest, Father Callaghan, was in Ireland for a year.<br><br>Emma touched the elegant, distinctive gold label of the Bracken 15 year old. "Do you miss Ireland?"<br><br>"Every day. That doesn't mean I'm unhappy here. What about you, Emma? Are you happy?"<br><br>His question caught her off guard. "Right now?"<br><br>"In your life. In what you do. In where you are, at this moment."<br><br>A cold draft came through the thin walls and worn floorboards. "I don't miss the convent, Father, if that's what you're asking."<br><br>He smiled. "You only call me 'Father' when you think I'm speaking about your life as a religious sister."<br><br>"I suppose you're right," she said with a small laugh. "Yes, Fin, I'm happy. In my work, in my private life. I haven't known Colin long but our relationship feels like the real thing. I understand that I'm a new addition to his life, and that his brothers regard me as impermanent."<br><br>"Is that how you feel, Emma? Impermanent?"<br><br>"Colin and I are very different. I know that much."<br><br>"You're worried about him, too. And you miss him."<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>She helped herself to a couple of the Simple White Stonewall Kitchen crackers Finian had provided, and his Donovan tasters hadn't touched, then poured water from one of Hurley's plastic pitchers. Finian disapproved of adding ice or water to whiskey but he encouraged having water on the side to help counter the dehydrating effects of the alcohol. Only during a tasting did he tolerate, if reluctantly, adding a bit of room-temperature water to the whiskey, which arguably helped with "nosing" the aromas, but there'd been no takers tonight.

Compelling historical true crime, <i>The Mad Bomber of New York</i>&nbsp;is the gripping tale of two individuals engaged in a deadly game of hide-and-seek, with the city of New York caught in the crosshairs.</p><p>"Fear, the city and one angry man.Greenburg (<i>Peaches &amp; Daddy: A Story of the Roaring &#x2019;20s, the Birth of Tabloid Media, and the Courtship that Captured the Hearts and Imaginations of the American Public</i>, 2008) relates the gripping and bizarre story of George Metesky, the Mad Bomber&#x201d; who, between 1940 and 1957, terrorized New York City with a series of pipe bombs placed in public restrooms, phone booths, theater seats and other public locations. Though his bombs caused no fatalities, 15 citizens sustained injuries, and Metesky&#x2019;s elusion of the police engendered extreme anxiety in the populace and frustrated and humiliated the NYPD. In a clear, engaging style, Greenburg marshals the complex facts of the decades-long saga and paints a sympathetically three-dimensional portrait of Metesky, a paranoid schizophrenic with a long-held grudge against the Con Edison power company for failure to pay workman&#x2019;s compensation after he sustained an injury in its employ. The manhunt would have far-reaching impact on police work, as desperate investigators turned to unconventional methods after being stymied in their pursuit; chief among these innovations was the decision to consult with prominent psychiatrist James Brussel in an attempt to infer personal details about the faceless terrorist through a sort of educated guesswork. Brussel&#x2019;s contributions proved strikingly germane, and criminal profiling&#x201d; would become a key component in investigations ever after. Metesky&#x2019;s legal battles after his capture would also prove influential, his tireless letter-writing campaign eventually leading to reforms in the handling of the criminally insane.A compelling account of a dangerously angry man and the investigation that helped to revolutionize modern police work."--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>&nbsp;<i></i>&nbsp;<br><br> A unique trip into the heart of the decades-long investigation to find the mystery man who held New York City in his deadly grip, and into the mind of a psychopath bent on revenge no matter the cost.

Michael M. Greenburg has put together a first-rate true-crime story that knocks your socks off and leaves you pondering the full meaning of insanity.&#x201d; Scott Christianson, author of <i>Bodies of Evidence: Forensic Science</i> and <i>Crime and Condemned: Inside the Sing Sing Death House </i>Greenburg (Peaches and Daddy) hits all the requisite marks in this intriguing but slow-moving chronicle of a serial bomber whose "career" spanned 16 years between 1940 and 1956. Dubbed the "Mad Bomber" by the New York City press, George Metesky's troubles began while he was working at Con Edison's Hell Gate power plant, when an industrial accident left him, he said, with chronic tuberculosis. His worker's compensation claim was denied on a technicality. Metesky&#x2014;later diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic&#x2014;devised a scheme to "punish" Con Ed by planting homemade pipe bombs throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn, first at a Con Ed plant, and then in public places, including Radio City Music Hall, Penn Station, Grand Central Station, and movie theaters. Miraculously, only eight people were injured and no one was killed during the spree. Greenburg's account picks up speed with Metesky's apprehension in 1957, after he published letters in a New York newspaper giving some identifying details. A debate raged over his competency to stand trial and which borough would try him. Greenburg, a practicing attorney, weights his account too heavily on the repetitious hunt for Metesky when his legal expertise might have been better used exploring the complex questions of legal competency.

Bowen sets her latest in the depths of the Depression, allowing hints of hard times to seep into even her upper-class milieu. Lady Georgiana Rannoch, the heroine of the Royal Spyness series (this is the sixth entry), is in line for succession to the throne. But she&#x2019;s thirty-fifth in line, enough to get invited to the occasional royal party but not enough to pay the rent. She&#x2019;s about to be evicted by repellent relatives from her family home, Castle Rannoch, in Scotland, when she sees an ad in The Lady asking for someone of &#x201c;impeccable background&#x201d; to supervise festivities at a country house in a tiny English village, Tiddleton-under-Lovey. The villagers seem to be accident-prone: one falls out of a tree and dies; another drowns; another is asphyxiated, prompting Lady Georgiana to turn from games-mistress to investigator. Bowen, who has won both the Agatha and Anthony Awards, gives us another tongue-in-cheek romp.

It was born through a will stronger than reason, and grew through suffering greater than human beings are expected to support.' But the new country, born out of victorious battle, is granted no peace."--Robert Capa, 1948<br><br>The year 1998 marks the fiftieth anniversary of a unique nation and the struggle that returned Jews to their homeland after centuries in exile. <i>Israel: 50 Years</i> celebrates the climactic forging of the Jewish state with images by the Magnum photographers who were there to record the daily life, joys, and sorrows of the Jews, Arabs, and Christians living in Palestine at the time of Israel's founding in 1948.<br><br>Israel's struggles and the life and culture of its people have been well documented, but never has a single volume captured so vividly the underlying forces of this epic story. Many of these memorable images alerted the world to the unfolding drama of a new nation as it began; others, taken as recently as yesterday, capture the youth of contemporary Israel, members of a new generation who want to move beyond old conflicts.<br><br>From its tenuous beginnings to the present day, Israel has been a special assignment for Magnum. Founding members Robert Capa and David Seymour were themselves Jewish �migr�s from central Europe who shared enormous enthusiasm for the struggle of the new arrivals and covered their story with deep affection, while fellow founding member Geroge Rodger documented the Arab exiles on Israel's borders, questioning the price of Jewish victory.<br><br>Organized by decade, chapters begin with introductory texts in which the photographers themselves reminisce about the turbulent events they covered and the memorable people they encountered throughout the chaotic fifty years of Israel's embattled statehood.<br></p><p>Magnum, the international documentary photographers&#39; cooperative, was established in 1947, just one year before the founding of Israel. Two of the most famous Magnum originators, Robert Capa and David Seymour, were Jewish American �migr�s from Central Europe; they took a special interest in the new state. This anniversary volume, organized by decade and interspersed with written observations by the photographers who were there, is an unflinching record of Israel&#39;s first 50 years. The pictures are truly historic: Menachem Begin in 1948, making a passionate speech, is caught with his fist in the air by Capa; in 1951 a baby named Miriam, the first child of a new Jewish settler, is depicted in her Italian baptismal robe; pools of blood congeal in a Jewish classroom; terrified Arab waifs cringe at the approach of Israeli troops; and a beautiful bride marrying a man with a furrowed brow is captured on film by the mischievous Elliott Erwitt in 1962. These are but five of the terribly moving pictures of &#34;the hardest place one can live,&#34; as Seymour wrote in 1948. But, he added, &#34;the young sing at night, and even the old ones talk about the future.&#34;<b>Magnum Photos</b>, since its inception in 1947, has been a cooperative of photographers at the forefront of reportage and documentary photography. Members have been key witnesses and interpreters of the world's events, and players and principals in the development of the medium. There are forty-four member photographers in Magnum, based in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, pursuing reportage stories, assignments, and other documentary projects. Magnum operates out of offices in New York, Paris, London, and Tokyo, with a network of other representatives around the word.<br></p><h2>Heather, the Totality</h2><p><b>The explosive debut novel - about family, power and privilege - from the creator of the award-winning Mad Men.</b><b><br></b><b>Named a <i>Barnes &amp; Noble </i>Best Book of the Year</b><br><b><br></b>Mark and Karen Breakstone have constructed the idyllic life of wealth and status they always wanted, made complete by their beautiful and extraordinary daughter Heather.

In 1971, however, he appeared on television to decry the doomed war effort in Vietnam. With About Face, he has written what many Vietnam veterans have called the most important book of their generation. From Korea to Berlin, from the Cuban missile crisis to Vietnam, Hackworth&#39;s story is that of an exemplary patriot, played out against the backdrop of the changing fortunes of America and the American military. It is also a stunning indictment of the Pentagon&#39;s fundamental misunderstanding of the Vietnam conflict and of the bureaucracy of self-interest that fuelled the war. Heavily decorated Colonel Hackworth narrates his life and disillusionment during Vietnam. Orphaned before he was a year old, he found his home at 15 in the Army. In Korea, heroism gave him a battlefield commission at 20. During the Cold War, he commanded at the Berlin wall and the Cuban missile crises. But Vietnam led to disillusionment.</p><p></p><h2>A Trumpet in the Wadi: A Novel</h2><p>Leading Israeli novelist Sami Michael shares his gift for navigating the cultural conflicts in modern Israel with <i>A Trumpet in the Wadi</i>, a novel that transcends its Middle Eastern setting with an honest and heartbreaking story of impossible love and the strength of family.<br><br>Set in the months preceding the 1982 Israeli-Arab conflict in Lebanon, this beautifully written tale is the coming-of-age story of two fatherless Christian Arab sisters, Huda and Mary, who live in the wadi -- the Arab quarter in the Jewish city of Haifa on the northern coast of Israel. An extraordinary bond of love and mutual respect unites the sisters -- polar opposites from their appearances to their tempers. Huda, the narrator of the story, is thin and withdrawn and, after abandoning her chance at marriage a few years back, has prematurely resigned herself to the monotonous life of an old maid. Her younger sister, Mary, is voluptuous, carnal, and perennially unemployed. Wrapped in the love of their sometimes bitter mother, their iconoclast grandfather, and the cheerful and omnipresent neighbor Jamilla, the sisters' lives change when a peculiar young Russian Jewish immigrant, Alex, moves into the upstairs flat. The melodies of the soulful trumpet player become the intoxicating theme music for Huda's unexpected reawakening -- and for Mary's dangerous foray into a love triangle with the heir of the local Muslim mob and her country cousin.<br><br>Michael's internationally acclaimed novel is a major achievement, illuminating the vast range of interlocking relationships between Jews and Arabs, Muslims and Christians, men and women. <i>A Trumpet in the Wadi</i> is an honest, witty, and ultimately heartbreaking story -- one that draws on the conflicts in the Middle East, but one whose insights into love and family can cross all cultural and political boundaries.</p><p><b>Sami Michael</b> was born in Baghdad in 1926.

It was said that Matthias the Prophet was stealing money from one of his followers; then came reports of lascivious sexual relations, based on odd teachings of matched spirits, apostolic priesthoods, and the inferiority of women. At its climax, the rumors transformed into legal charges, as the Prophet was arrested for the murder of a once highly-regarded Christian gentleman who had fallen under his sway. By the time the story played out, it became one of the nation's first penny-press sensations, casting a peculiar but revealing light on the sexual and spiritual tensions of the day.<br> In <em>The Kingdom of Matthias</em>, the distinguishd historians Paul Johnson and Sean Wilentz brilliantly recapture this forgotten story, imbuing their richly researched account with the dramatic force of a novel. In this book, the strange tale of Matthias the Prophet provides a fascinating window into the turbulent movements of the religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening--movements which swept up great numbers of evangelical Americans and gave rise to new sects like the Mormons. Into this teeming environment walked a down-and-out carpenter named Robert Matthews, who announced himself as Matthias, prophet of the God of the Jews. His hypnotic spell drew in a cast of unforgettable characters--the meekly devout businessman Elijah Pierson, who once tried to raise his late wife from the dead; the young attractive Christian couple, Benjamin Folger and his wife Ann (who seduced the woman-hating Prophet); and the shrewd ex-slave Isabella Van Wagenen, regarded by some as "the most wicked of the wicked." None was more colorful than the Prophet himself, a bearded, thundering tyrant who gathered his followers into an absolutist household, using their money to buy an elaborate, eccentric wardrobe, and reordering their marital relations. By the time the tensions within the kingdom exploded into a clash with the law, Matthias had become a national scandal.<br> In the hands of Johnson and Wilentz, the strange tale of the Prophet and his kingdom comes vividly to life, recalling scenes from recent experiences at Jonestown and Waco. They also reveal much about a formative period in American history, showing the connections among rapid economic change, sex and race relations, politics, popular culture, and the rich varieties of American religious experience.</p><p><br><em>About the Authors:</em><br> <strong>Paul E. Johnson</strong> is teaches history at the University of Utah, and is the author of <em>A Shopkeeper's Millennium</em>. <strong>Sean Wilentz</strong> is Professor of History at Princeton University. An editor of <em>Dissent</em>, and a regular contributor to <em>The New Republic</em>, he is also the author of <em>Chants Democratic</em>.<br>Combining rare narrative skills and historical detail, Johnson (History/Univ. of Utah) and Wilentz (History/Princeton) recreate the fascinating tale of a false prophet and his misguided followers in New York in the 1820s and '30s. The authors reveal the social, economic, racial, and sexual conditions that give rise to apocalyptic cults and their virile, charismatic leaders. A whole series of evangelical cults appeared in the early decades of the 19th century to serve the poor, the emotionally needy, those excluded from the new prosperity, optimism, tolerance, personal freedom, and rational belief of the mercantile classes. Elijah Pierson started the Retrenchment Society to rescue prostitutes but became deranged himself when he was unable to raise his wife from the dead. Robert Matthews, later Matthias, an impoverished carpenter who had beaten and abandoned his wife and children, engaged Pierson's interest and used his resources to start his own Kingdom, a communal patriarchy that advocated ``abundant'' food, naked bathing, wife-swapping, and complete obedience. Fully bearded, dressed in bizarre costumes of ruffles, pantaloons, and a magician's cap, the deranged Matthias ``damned'' wives who worked, men who wore spectacles, and most Christians. Inevitably, his anarchic thinking came in conflict with the law, and although he was suspected of poisoning Pierson and stealing his money, Matthias was convicted only of beating his daughter and jailed for 30 days. The lurid trial dominated the new ``penny'' journalism, generating pamphlets and books alerting Christians against fanaticism. But to the slaves, the improvident, and the laboring classes, Matthias and similar cults offered a refuge and inspiration. A black servant, for instance, had her own revelation in 1843 and was reborn as Sojourner Truth, abolitionist ex-slave.

Deluxe Edition</h2><p>An unforgettable hardcover collection of WATCHMEN writer Alan Moore&#39;s definitive Superman tales that is sure to appeal of readers of his BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE graphic novel. Moore teams with Curt Swan, the definitive Superman artist from the 1950&#39;s through the 1970&#39;s, to tell the final adventure of the Man of Steel featuring his last stand against Lex Luthor, Brainiac and his other foes in &#34;WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE MAN OF TOMORROW?&#34;. This volume also includes Moore&#39;s classic early collaboration with WATCHMEN illustrator Dave Gibbons, &#34;FOR THE MAN WHO HAS EVERYTHING&#34;, in which Batman, Robin and Wonder Woman find Superman held captive by the villain Mongul in the Fortress of Solitude and dreaming of an idyllic life on Krypton courtesy of a wish-fulfilling parasitic plant known as the Black Mercy. Both tales are considered two of the top five all-time best Superman stories among fans.The rare first team-up adventure between the Man of Tomorrow and Swamp Thin</p><p>Alan Moore is one of the most respected and admired writers in comics today, with a host of industry awards and accolades. His credits include The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Swamp Thing, Tom Strong, V For Vendetta and Watchmen. Curt Swan was the artist on Superman for over three decades, prior to his death in 1996, drawing the daily Superman comic as well as his longer-form comics adventures.&#34;When it comes to comics as literature, there are few writers more revered than Alan Moore. The smart, searing work of Moore -- Watchmen, From Hell, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen -- is arguably the best that comics have to offer.&#34;</p><h2>Independence Day</h2><p>A novel continuing the story of Frank Bascomb, the hero of THE SPORTSWRITER, a middle-class, middle-aged American who is estranged from his wife and who prepares to take his fifteen year old son on a two-day driving trip over the Independence Day weekend, in order to visit halls of fame and have heart-to heart conversations.</p><p>Another title for Ford&#39;s 1996 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel might be &#34;The Return of Frank Bascombe.&#34; Bascombe, in this sequel to Ford&#39;s 10-year-old The Sportswriter, comes close to taking his place with John Updike&#39;s Rabbit Angstrom in the pantheon of confused white middle-class American literary protagonists. At age 44 he has entered what Bascombe calls &#34;the Existence Period, the high-wire act of normalcy, the part that comes after the big struggle which led to the big blowup.&#34; Bascombe&#39;s almost comic indecisiveness has led to the breakup of his marriage, a detached, wary affair, and an achingly fragile relationship with his troubled teenage son, Paul.

Although most of these accounts appeared before the Civil War, more than one-third are the result of the ambitious efforts of the Federal Writers' Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to interview surviving ex-slaves during the 1930s. The result of these efforts was the Slave Narrative Collection, a group of autobiographical accounts of former slaves that today stands as one of the most enduring and noteworthy achievements of the WPA. Compiled in seventeen states during the years 1936-38, the collection consists of more than two thousand interviews with former slaves, most of them first-person accounts of slave life and the respondents' own reactions to bondage. The interviews afforded aged ex-slaves an unparalleled opportunity to give their personal accounts of life under the "peculiar institution," to describe in their own words what it felt like to be a slave in the United States.<br>&#x2015;Norman R.

Browsable reads to whet the appetite. The "editors" (authors) of these two volumes have hit upon a unifying theme to chronicle the accomplishments of the ancients?a newspaper style. The Roman News and The Greek News are not exactly major city dailies; their format is more suggestive of a news magazine or at least a Sunday section highlighting fashion, sports, trade, food, and the military. Each page presents readable articles complete with headlines, boldface, column breaks, illustrations, and, often classifieds: instruments for sale; racing chariots built to order; reusable wax tablets. The front page (book cover) suggests a scope of approximately 1200 years, and the rise and fall of each empire is explained. A publisher's disclaimer also cautions that the ancients did not have newspapers (of course, they didn't even have paper!), but if they had, "they would have been reading...." Similar comments dart in and out of the news stories so that the entire tone is more human interest than ready reference. Such editorializing, however, only slightly distracts from the facts, which are accurate. Significant dates and events are all newsworthy. "Olympic Games Spoiled," "Caesar Stabbed," and "Hannibal Invades" are typical stories. The slightly oversized pages with decorative borders, sidebars, ads, and cartoons create an interesting layout. Many teachers would probably rejoice with the delivery of The Greek or Roman News as a project for a social-studies or whole-language unit. Kids can adopt this highly readable, albeit slightly sensationalized journalistic style. All in all, serviceable reporting.?Harriett Fargnoli, Great Neck Library, NY<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>AiON Volume 1</h2><p>While trying to live up to his father&#39;s dying wish of becoming an upstanding man, Tatsuya interferes in a classmate being bullied only to find himself in the middle of a supernatural war.</p><p></p><h2>The Dark Forest (The Three-Body Problem)</h2><p>Imagine the universe as a forest, patrolled by numberless and nameless predators. In this forest, stealth is survival - any civilisation that reveals its location is prey. Earth has. Now the predators are coming. Crossing light years, they will reach Earth in four centuries&#39; time. But the sophons, their extra-dimensional agents and saboteurs, are already here. Only the individual human mind remains immune to their influence. This is the motivation for the Wallfacer Project, a last-ditch defence that grants four individuals almost absolute power to design secret strategies, hidden through deceit and misdirection from human and alien alike. Three of the Wallfacers are influential statesmen and scientists, but the fourth is a total unknown. Luo Ji, an unambitious Chinese astronomer, is baffled by his new status.

In a small Greek island village, a group of travelers from around the world and the local residents they encounter are brought together in unexpected ways when sudden tragedy strikes. Here is the story of old Andreas, the gentle taverna owner who has spent years regretting the argument that drove his only son to America; Elsa, the beautiful German reporter who gave up her television career and the man she loved; and Fiona, the Irish nurse who's gone off to travel with the man everyone says is wrong for her.

The novel's opening scenes require her to vocalize characters from England, Germany, Greece, Ireland, and the United States, and she applies authentic accents to each. As these characters--residents and tourists on a Greek island--witness a tragedy, they form unique bonds through which they come to resolve personal issues. Donnelly beautifully emotes the pain, regret, and joy Binchy's characters experience. She characterizes young and old, male and female with fitting, believable, and easily distinguishable voices. The author's pleasant, if protracted, story shines amid Donnelly's charming and spirited reading.

He nearly made it.<br><br>Twenty-seven miles from Coolman&#x2019;s destination, an old green Firebird bashed his car from behind. The impact failed to trigger the Buick&#x2019;s airbags, but Coolman heard the rear bumper dragging. He steered off the highway and dialed 911. In the mirror he saw the Firebird, its grille crimped and steaming, pull onto the shoulder. Ahead stood a sign that read: &#x201c;Ramrod Key.&#x201d;<br><br>Coolman went to check on the other driver, a woman in her mid-thirties with red hair.<br><br>&#x201c;Super-duper sorry,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;What the hell happened?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just a nick. Barely bleeding.&#x201d; She held her phone in one hand and a disposable razor in the other.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you out of your mind?&#x201d; said Coolman.<br><br>The driver&#x2019;s jeans and panties were bunched around her knees. She&#x2019;d been shaving herself when she smashed Coolman&#x2019;s rental car.<br><br>&#x201c;I got a date,&#x201d; she explained.<br><br>&#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t take care of that at home?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No way! My husband would get so pissed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Unreal,&#x201d; said Coolman.<br><br>The woman was wearing a maroon fleece jacket and rhinestone flip-flops. On her pale thigh was the razor mark.<br><br>&#x201c;How about a little privacy?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not quite done here.&#x201d;<br><br>Coolman walked back to the Buick and called the man he was supposed to meet in Key West. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be a few minutes late. You&#x2019;re not gonna believe what just happened,&#x201d; he said on the man&#x2019;s voicemail, leaving it at that.<br><br>The cops arrived and wrote up the red-haired pube shaver for careless driving. Naturally, she had no collision insurance; that would be Avis&#x2019;s problem, not Lane Coolman&#x2019;s. A tow truck hauled away the Firebird, which needed a new front end including a radiator. The woman approached Coolman and asked for a ride.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell your &#x2018;date&#x2019; to come get you,&#x201d; he said. One of the police officers had pried the damaged bumper from the Buick, and Coolman was trying to fit it into the backseat.<br><br>&#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t have a car,&#x201d; said the woman, who&#x2019;d buttoned her jeans. She was attractive in a loose and scattered way. Coolman had a weakness for redheads.<br><br>&#x201c;See, I work for an escort service. We go to where the client&#x2019;s at,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I understand the concept.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman&#x2019;s fleece was unzipped and beneath it she wore a black sequined top. Her toes must be freezing in those flip-flops, Coolman thought; the temperature was 55 degrees with a biting north wind, arctic conditions for the Florida Keys.<br><br>&#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Merry,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;spelled like Merry Christmas.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Bob,&#x201d; said Coolman, &#x201c;spelled like Bob.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does that mean you&#x2019;ll give me a lift?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not,&#x201d; Coolman said, the worst mistake he would ever make.<br><br>At Mile Marker 22, Merry told him her last name was Mansfield, like the bombshell actress of the Fifties. Coolman stopped at a Circle K where he got a cup of coffee and Merry bought three eight-hour energy drinks, chugging the little purple bottles one after the other.<br><br>&#x201c;You running a marathon?&#x201d; Coolman asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m all about performance.&#x201d;<br><br>At Mile Marker 17, she told him she didn&#x2019;t really work for an escort service.<br><br>&#x201c;Wild guess&#x2014;you&#x2019;re a dancer,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;On my own time,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;Not one of those.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean it in a bad way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you just say stripper?

Buck Nance and his brothers were actually from Wisconsin, but the network paid for a Cajun dialogue coach.<br><br>Merry said, &#x201c;So what brings you all the way down here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Buck has a personal appearance.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Parched Pirate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Doing what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just being Buck.&#x201d;<br><br>Coolman hoped the guitar player had found the bar. Buck Nance had trouble speaking in public unless he was accompanied by a live musician. For his road gigs the writers at the network had come up with eight or nine amusing redneck stories, what you might call a monologue, and afterward Buck would take questions for ten minutes or so. The questions were printed on index cards distributed in advance to random fuckwits in the crowd.<br><br>Coolman offered to take Merry to the show. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll hang backstage,&#x201d; he added. Like there was a backstage.<br><br>&#x201c;What about my date?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Bail,&#x201d; Coolman said. &#x201c;Tell him the truth&#x2014;you had car trouble.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But then I shaved down there for no reason.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not necessarily.&#x201d;<br><br>The redhead smiled and shook her head. &#x201c;For the Zac Brown Band I&#x2019;d ditch my Navy boy in a heartbeat, but not for some yahoo from the bayou.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s only the top-rated cable program in the whole country.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I prefer the nature channels. You know&#x2014;penguins and cheetahs. Shit like that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Buck converted his Bentley to an ATV with rifle racks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why would a grown man do something so ridiculous?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;America worships the guy. You should come hear him tonight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Another time,&#x201d; said Merry.<br><br>At Mile Marker 5, she made a call on her cell phone. All she said was, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t wet yourself, sugar. I&#x2019;m almost there.&#x201d;<br><br>At Mile Marker 4, after they&#x2019;d crossed the bridge into Key West, she flipped open the visor mirror and checked her makeup. Freshened her lipstick. Brushed her hair.<br><br>&#x201c;You look terrific,&#x201d; said Coolman.<br><br>&#x201c;Damn right, Bob.&#x201d;<br><br>At Mile Marker 3, she exclaimed, &#x201c;Okay, pull in here!&#x201d;<br><br>It was a small shopping center with a Sears as the high point. Merry directed Coolman where to park. He was surprised when a white Tesla rolled up beside them.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s your boyfriend?&#x201d; Coolman knew a couple of CAA agents back in L.A. who drove jet-black Teslas. The white model looked pretty sweet. Coolman himself leased a corpuscle-red Mercedes SLK 350 that required no electric outlet.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought you said he didn&#x2019;t have wheels.&#x201d;<br><br>Merry shrugged. &#x201c;Must be a loaner.&#x201d;<br><br>The young man who got out of the Tesla was wearing a leather bomber jacket. If not for the gold earring and oily long hair he could have been a Navy pilot.<br><br>&#x201c;It was nice meeting you,&#x201d; Coolman said to the redhead.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re coming with.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me? What for?&#x201d;<br><br>The man in the bomber jacket yanked open Coolman&#x2019;s door and put a pistol to his neck.<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go, dipshit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just take my wallet,&#x201d; Coolman said, breathless. &#x201c;The Rolex, too, whatever you want.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re adorable, Bob,&#x201d; the woman whispered. &#x201c;Now get out of the fucking car.&#x201d;</p><h2>Literary Transcendentalism: Style and Vision in the American Renaissance (Cornell Paperbacks)</h2><p><p>Broader in scope than any previous literary study of the transcendentalists, this rewarding book analyzes the theories and forms characteristic of a vital group of American writers, as well as the principles and vision underlying transcendentalism. All the movement's major literary figures and forms are considered in detail. </p><p>Lawrence Buell combines intellectual history and critical explication, giving equal attention to general trends and to particular works and individuals. His chapters on conversation, religious discourse, catalog rhetoric, and literary travelogue treat intensively topics that have been relatively neglected. His analyses of Ellery Channing's poetry and the use of persona in Emerson and Very are also innovative. In the final section, he offers the first systematic account of the autobiographical tradition in transcendentalist writing.</p><p>This incisive and sympathetic overview of transcendentalist writing and thought will attract readers interested in American culture, and it will suggest new critical approaches to nonfiction.</p></p><p><p>Lawrence Buell is Powell M.

Betts <i>College Literature</i>)<br><br><p>"Buell's solid grasp of the religiousness of the transcendental literary discipline is a welcome insight. Buell finds that truth and beauty are two sides of the same transcendental coin, and this perception shapes a very fine book."</p> (Catherine Albanese <i>Church History</i>)<br><br><p>"Lawrence Buell's <i>Literary Transcendentalism</i> is one of the best studies of the literature of the American renaissance to appear in quite some time; it takes what might well be thought academy-worn subjects and says interesting and suggestive things about them.

He has written fifty-five books on the subject (before this one) and over three hundred published articles. These decades of scholarship are complemented by direct military experience as a US army officer (now retired). <br><br>This book presents his thoughts and perspectives on a selection of aspects of ancient warfare that he has found of particular interest over the years. It does not aim to be a comprehensive overview nor a coherent narrative of ancient military history but adds up to an illuminating, fascinating and wide-ranging discussion of various topics. With topics ranging from the origins of war, through logistics, military medicine and psychiatry or the origins of jihad, to specifics such as the generalship of Alexander the Great (Gabriel&#x2019;s not a fan), Scipio and Hannibal, there is plenty here for the either the general reader or academic scholar.</p><p>Richard A.

He has also been professor of history and politics at the U.S. Army War College and held the Visiting Chair in Military Ethics at the Marine Corps University. A retired U.S. Army officer living in Manchester, New Hampshire, Gabriel is the author of numerous books and articles on military history and other subjects and has made many appearances as an historical expert on TV documentaries.</p><h2>Prized Possessions: Dutch Paintings from National Trust Houses</h2><p>Celebrating the enduring British taste for collecting Dutch paintings from the long seventeenth century, this exhibition catalog will explore why and how this particular type of art was desired, commissioned, and displayed, through the consideration of Golden Age masterpieces from a number of National Trust houses.<br><br>This catalog will be published to accompany the first ever exhibition of Golden Age Dutch pictures in the collection of the National Trust, which will be shown at the Mauritshuis in The Hague, the Holburne Museum in Bath and at Petworth House in West Sussex (2018&#x2013;19). It will feature portraits, still lifes, religious pictures, maritime paintings, landscapes, genre paintings and history pictures, painted by celebrated artists such as Rembrandt, Lievens, Hobbema, Cuyp, Hondecoeter, De Heem, Ter Borch and Metsu, as well as less well-known artists such as De Baen and Van Diest. With over 350 heritage properties in the UK, the National Trust cares for one of the world&#x2019;s largest and most significant holdings of art and its collection of Dutch Old Masters is particularly impressive. <br><br>The catalog will include essays by Quentin Buvelot (chief curator at the Mauritshuis) and David Taylor (curator of pictures and sculpture at the National Trust).

The fever dream of Peter the Great, Pushkin, Dostoyevsky, Gogol, and Akhmatova, St. Petersburg is the occasion for a broader meditation on all we come to love and lose. Pictures began as a journal notebook in 2002, as the poet tried to capture this spectacle-rich and memory-laden city that he had visited ten years before. Scored to the movements of Modest Mussorgsky&#x2019;s legendary suite&#x2015;a work of art elegizing a lost friend, the artist Hartmann&#x2015;Pictures marks, and sometimes sings, the incommensurability of word and world.</p><p>In <i>Pictures at an Exhibition</i>, Philip Metres has done for contemporary Russian literature more than any American of his generation that I can think of. To this remarkable work, he brings the full richness of his poetic gift. As a native St.Petersburger, I recognize the very essence, the hidden, ever-evanescent core of that unreal, strikingly literary and literal and palpably artificial city captured in these poems. His writes with love, he writes with verve, and with passionate skill. What he does is both beautiful and important. *Piter* owes him a debt of gratitude.--Mikhail Iossel, author of <i>Every Hunter Wants to Know: A Leningrad Life</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Pictures at an Exhibition: A Petersburg Album</i> takes its name from Modest Musorgsky's moody music meant to simulate a stroll through a gallery, but the "pictures" Philip Metres describes are fraught with all the tensions that place, history, language, and self can mingle . . . . Inventive and various in its approach to what structures a poem, here are constant risks and delights in the "album" of observations deeply informed by the emotional history of what it means to know a country, a city, and a language both translated and untranslatable.--Maxine Chernoff, author of <i>Here</i> and <i>The Selected Poems of Friedrich H�lderlin</i>Philip Metres is the author of a number of books, including <i>Sand Opera</i> (2015), <i>I Burned at the Feast: Selected Poems of Arseny Tarkovsky</i> (2015), <i>A Concordance of Leaves</i> (2013), <i>To See the Earth</i> (2008), and<i> Behind the Lines: War Resistance Poetry on the American Homefront since 1941</i> (2007).

Misunderstood by the public at large during his lifetime, and embraced by a cult of fans that has consistently grown since his premature death from cancer, Kaufman is the perfect counter-cultural martyr, ripe for a Gap khakis ad. Like Lenny Bruce before him, Kaufman chafed at the reigns of comedy; he didn't always want to make people laugh, in fact he wished to make them uncomfortable. One might consider those notorious French bad-boy playwrights Alfred Jarry and Antonin Artaud (who pushed the envelope of good taste and thoroughly enjoyed confusing their audiences) to be Kaufman's spiritual predecessors, though this might be taking things too seriously. His most well-known routines--the inept stand-up comedian "foreign man," the basis for the character Latka Gravas on the hit sitcom "Taxi"; the grizzled, professional lounge lizard Tony Clifton; and the reigning world champion of inter-gender wrestling--all hinged on making the crowd squirm. Life was a show for Kaufman, who began staging elaborate shows for friends and family at the age of 7; everything was a put-on and yet totally, dead-on serious.<p> Judging by Bob Zmuda's book (released in anticipation of a biographical movie starring Jim Carrey), Kaufman wasn't the easiest guy to be a best friend to. But, as Zmuda tells things, he rose to the challenge--letting Kaufman confide that he had a daughter he'd never seen, keeping his mouth shut at the appropriate times, and otherwise fulfilling best-friend duties with aplomb. Andy Kaufman got the friend he deserved in his lifetime, but this is not the biography he deserves; it is written in a well-meaning though hackneyed and hard-to-digest style. Simple points are made again and again, as if the two(!) authors were attempting to fuse a poorly-written college essay with a <i>USA Today</i> article. And Mr. Zmuda makes the mistake of assuming that his own history will be of much interest to the reader, who is ostensibly reading a tell-all about <i>Kaufman</i>, not his best friend. There are tremendous anecdotes here; about half the book is filled with glorious tales of artful mischief, hijinks, pranks, and funny stuff that Zmuda and Kaufman pulled on friends, crowds, and strangers. Fans will undoubtedly want to pick this one up, while those with a more casual interest are cautioned to perhaps look elsewhere for a less clumsily written tome. <i>--Mike McGonigal</i></p>Bob Zmuda is an American author, comedian, producer and director best known as the sidekick, co-writer and friend of cult personality Andy Kaufman. Bob Zmuda occasionally portrayed Kaufman's Tony Clifton character on stage and for television appearances.

Starting life as the prototypical "middle-class kid," he endured his father's early death, his mother's descent into major depression, and life on his own from the age of sixteen. In spite of his own bad habits, he penetrated the far-flung, sometimes exotic worlds of magazines, movies, pornography, and television. His byline appeared everywhere from Esquire and Playboy to L.A. Style, Hustler, and The Village Voice, while he penned scripts for twisted cult film classics like Cafe Flesh and Dr. Caligari. Eventually, he ended up in the big-buck world of network television, banging out shows for mega-hits like Moonlighting, ALF, and thirtysomething. But even when he was making five grand a week, he was shooting six.<br>Beneath the successful front ran a toxic undercurrent of betrayal and madness, hard narcotics and hardcore sex. Permanent Midnight captures the crazed reality of this double and triple life. Careening daily from his luxury home to L.A.'s most hellacious neighborhoods, from the rankest methadone clinic to the backlot at Twentieth Century-Fox, he financed a heroin habit that brought on the soothing hiss of oblivion, even as it stole his health and trashed his career. Until, in a private apocalypse straight out of Day of the Locusts, Jerry Stahl kicked smack and emerged clean.</p><p>Jerry Stahl was born in Pittsburgh. He is author of the novels, I, Fatty, Perv: A Love Story, and Plainclothes, Naked. He currently lives in Los Angeles.It's not pretty and it's not "professional," but it's Jerry Stahl's true story of his life as a writer. Beginning his career as a pornographer for <i>Beaver</i> magazine, Stahl later wrote fake sex letters for <i>Penthouse</i> and articles for <i>Hustler</i> before moving on to write scripts for such TV hits as <i>Moonlighting, Thirtysomething,</i> and <i>Alf,</i> jobs that put almost $7,000 a week in his bank account. This is also the story of Stahl's addictions to smack, coke, crack, Dilaudids--you name it. Moving between $100 L.A. lunches and meetings with Cybill Shepherd to dangerous scores in the worst parts of the city, Stahl managed to lose his family, his house, his screenwriting opportunity for the second season of <i>Twin Peaks,</i> and nearly his life. <i>Permanent Midnight</i> is not for people with delicate sensibilities or any other low thresholds for truth. Stahl's autobiography provides no glitzy Hollywood confessional with raised letters on the dust jacket, and it's not a self-help book on recovery. Instead, it explores, with brutal honesty and humor, the author's struggle between the nightmares of addiction and the nightmares of sobriety. <i>Permanent Midnight</i> is one of the most harrowing and toughest accounts ever written in this century about what it means to be a junkie in America, making Burroughs look dated and Kerouac appear as the nose-thumbing adolescent he was. Recommended for the true elite: those who can tell themselves a joke while slitting their own throats. <i>Greg Burkman</i></p><h2>Water Angels (Malin)</h2><p>A married couple is found dead in their jacuzzi.

It is full of astonishing material, such as Kissinger's trying to secure the evacuation of a Marine company which, at the very last minute, is discovered to still be in Saigon as the city is about to fall, and his exchanges with Ambassador Martin in Saigon, who is reluctant to leave his embassy. <br> This is a book that presents perhaps the best record of the inner workings of diplomacy at the superheated pace and tension of real crisis.</p><p>Henry Kissinger was the fifty-sixth Secretary of State.

Written by a master of twentieth-century Hungarian literature, it describes life for the Jewish population of German-occupied Budapest&#x2015;the constant fear of deportation overshadowing the daily trials of living in the ghetto&#x2015;before concentrating on the writer's own internment in a labor camp during the first weeks of rule by the extremist Arrow Cross regime. The experiences of those nineteen days spent in the camp are both harsh and disturbing, yet throughout his memoir Szep manages to maintain an extraordinary degree of compassion and detachment, even humor. Published to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the events described, this is the last of Szep's many literary works to appear in English."</p><p>The Smell of Humans recapitulates the events following the German occupation of Hungary in March 1944, and then narrates the 19-day story of the forced march, the prison camp at the brick factory, the digging of trenches outside Budapest, the round-the-clock exposure to the elements and to the whims of the guards (ranging from taunts to summary executions), until the release of the author three weeks later, when the regular army took the labourers out of the hands of the Arrow Cross henchmen. Primarily a piece of creative writing and autobiographical literature of a very distinctive Central European kind, this detailed and imaginative short memoir is also an important document of the Holocaust in Hungary in 1944. What is unique is Szep&#39;s tone, a meld of stupefaction and irony. Without overt condemnation or succumbing to despair, he somehow manages to describe, in precise detail, a series of events along progressively grosser stages of infamy. These daily mounting horrors acquire an additional intensity generated by the author&#39;s wide-eyed, childlike refusal to accept the fact of man&#39;s inhumanity to man.<br>Ern� Sz�p, poet, playwright, and novelist, died 1953.<br></p><h2>Bells and Man</h2><p>Traces the history of bells and their use by different civilizations, examines their connection with Christian churches, and discusses the use of bells to make music, mark time, and signal events</p><p></p><h2>Wonderlands</h2><p>Wonderlands The Illustration Art of Robert Ingpen</p><p>Robert Ingpen was born in 1936 in Geelong, Australia, and still lives and works nearby in Barwon Heads.

Reprint.</p><p>Charmingly original, with the occasional cuteness redeemed by a suddenly exposed hard edge, Haddam's ninth Gregor Demarkian holiday mystery begins in February on the busy streets of an Armenian neighborhood in Philadelphia. Tongues wag when 58-year-old Hannah Krekorian takes up with Paul Hazzard, a psychologist famous for his books and his seminars and for the nasty death of his wife four years earlier, a crime for which he was tried but never convicted. When Hazzard is murdered in Hannah's bedroom, his blood staining the same ornamental dagger that also figured in his wife's death, Hannah is an immediate suspect. Series hero Gregor, a former FBI agent, takes up Hannah's cause and casts his eye on the dead man's magnificently dysfunctional trio of grown-up children and his former mistress, who is soon to publish a tell-all tale. Aiding Gregor is his no-nonsense lover, fantasy writer Bennis Hannaford. While Gregor considers the unusual entry wounds on Hazzard's body and those featured on the next victim, the author details several believable romances that flourish and flounder on Cavanaugh Street. Never quite cozy and never quite tough, this tale combines the best of both styles to stunning effect. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Haddam's nine previous Gregor Demarkian stories each features a holiday theme. Her latest focuses on Valentine's Day as it's celebrated on Philadelphia's Cavanaugh Street, home to retired FBI agent Demarkian and a host of fellow Armenian immigrants. Everyone in the neighborhood is surprised when homely Hanna Krekorian turns up with a new man in her life, but Demarkian is especially shocked when he finds that Hanna's friend is none other than Paul Hazzard, who was once suspected of violently murdering his wife. Hazzard may have some kind of twisted motive for courting Hanna--but what? To compound the mystery, Hazzard's former lover, Candida DeWitt, is on the verge of publishing her tell-all memoirs, which may reveal whether Hazzard was indeed guilty of murder. When Hazzard is stabbed to death at Hanna's house and Hanna seems the most likely suspect, Demarkian decides it's time to step in. Loyal Demarkian fans will thoroughly enjoy the formidable detective's latest adventure, which sports Haddam's usual deft writing, skillful plotting, and gentle humor. Readers who don't know the series will find Demarkian and his Armenian neighbors refreshing and entertaining. <i>Emily Melton</i></p><h2>First Australians: An Illustrated History</h2><p><i>First Australians</i>, the companion book to the epic SBS TV series, is the dramatic story of the collision of two worlds that created contemporary Australia.

Pepper was released. In September 1968, critically acclaimed photojournalist Don McCullin was invited to spend a day photographing The Beatles in locations ranging from Paul McCartney&#x2019;s garden to the banks of the Thames, as well as in their recording studio. The timing of this was, in hindsight, significant. The Beatles had just released Sgt. Pepper, Vietnam was in turmoil, and riots had spread through America&#x2019;s cities and campuses. It was the moment when the innocence and optimism of the sixties darkened&#x2014;the instant the youth movement, of which The Beatles were icons, converged with the antiwar protests, the civil rights movement, and the burgeoning counterculture. One of the most poignant photographs taken that day was of John Lennon posing as dead, surrounded by the other three band members. Lennon himself carefully choreographed the image as a pose of protest, but it is now seen as tragic and strangely prophetic. These images of four inspired artists at the pinnacle of success and on the cusp of transformation mark the passing of an era, and in them, we can glimpse our own lost youth.</p><p>Don McCullin was an acclaimed war photographer of the late twentieth century. The winner of numerous awards, including two Premier Awards from the World Press Photo, he became the only photojournalist to be made Commander of the British Empire. He is the author of several books and was awarded the 2006 Cornell Capa Award by the International Center for Photography in New York. Paul McCartney gained worldwide fame as a member of The Beatles and is listed in the Guinness World Records as the &#34;most successful musician and composer in popular music history.&#34;"These images of four inspired artists, at the pinnacle of their success and on the cusp of transformation, mark a time of radical cultural evolution.

At night, she is Indigo, vigilante crime fighter who can bend shadows to her will and use them with deadly force. Nora's parents were killed when she was young, and she has always wondered where her powers came from. She has dedicated her life to eradicating the Children of Phonos and their child-smuggling ring. When a high-ranking Phonos member captures Nora and reveals that her power is the result of an ancient murder god living inside her, Nora's mind begins to fracture. Ten brilliant authors, including Jonathan Maberry, Harris, and Seanan McGuire, collaborated on this tale, but the slow first half of this book is a case of too many cooks in the kitchen. However, the second half&#x2014;which coincides with the introduction of Damastes, the murder god who possesses Nora&#x2014;is nail-bitingly tense, and the carnage-soaked finale will satisfy readers. The second half is a clinic on how to blend writing styles effectively; the first half is an exposition on how not to.

The Alpine/Emma Lord series has created interest in the site, which was named a Washington State ghost town in July 2011. An organization called the Alpine Advocates has been formed to preserve what remains of the town as a historic site.ONE<br>Ed Bronsky was leaving a strange trail behind him on Alpine's grapevine. The Alpine Advocate's former ad manager was creating a stir with his unusual behavior. He'd been spotted at the Grocery Basket stuffing bananas in his raincoat pocket, at Cal Vickers's Texaco station putting only three gallons of gas into his Mercedes, and leaving the Burger Barn without paying for his double deluxe bacon cheeseburger with extra fries. Indeed, I had noticed him in church at St. Mildred's dropping coins into the collection basket instead of waving a check with his usual flourish.<br><br>My House &amp; Home editor, Vida Runkel, was sorely tempted to put some of those occurrences into her weekly gossip column, "Scene Around Town," but even she felt there might be something seriously wrong with Ed. Many years earlier, he'd quit his job at the Advocate after inheriting a pile of money from an aunt. Ever since then he and his wife, Shirley, and their five children had lived the high life--or as high as you can get in Alpine, with its four thousand residents living in semi-isolation eight miles from the Stevens Pass summit.<br><br>I was about to discover the answer.<br><br>Ed had wedged himself into one of my two visitors' chairs on this first Monday morning in January. He looked more pugnacious than crazy.<br><br>"I want my old job back," he said without any preamble.<br><br>I was aghast. "What?"<br><br>Ed nodded once, his three chins settling into his Burberry muffler. "That's right. I'm--we're--broke."<br><br>Given the rumor mill, I wasn't completely bowled over. But I was still flabbergasted. "What happened?" I asked, pretending I hadn't heard his request to be reinstated. "I thought you had a financial adviser."<br><br>Ed cleared his throat. "I do. But . . ." He averted his eyes. "The dot-com disaster, 9/11, the whole downturn thing . . . plus, I made a few investments on the side. They didn't turn out so good."<br><br>I had to ask. "What kind of investments?"<br><br>Ed shot me a swift, furtive glance. "Prune-based fuel. Plastic tires. Paper shoes."<br><br>I didn't know what to say. "Those sound like kind of far-fetched ideas, Ed."<br><br>He pounded his pudgy fist on the table. "No! Think about it! We're ruining the planet by relying on traditional natural resources. We've got to find other solutions. We have to seek unusual means to maintain our quality of life. Was Ben Franklin flying a kite far-fetched? You bet. But look what happened."<br><br>I sensed that this spiel wasn't Ed's but had come from whoever had conned him into his bad investments.<br><br>He sighed and swiped at the comb-over that hid part of his bald dome. "There goes Stanford. Shirley and I really wanted to send at least one of our kids there."<br><br>It would have been unkind to point out that even if the Bronskys could have sent one of their five children to Stanford, that didn't mean that child would get in. I figured Ed would have had to endow most of the Bay Area to get his offspring accepted at the academically challenging Palo Alto school.<br><br>But I had to say something. "I'm so sorry, Ed."<br><br>He shrugged, the powdered sugar on his cashmere overcoat sprinkling the air of my cubbyhole office like tiny snowflakes. "You got any more of those doughnuts?" he asked.<br><br>"I think you ate the last three," I said.<br><br>"Oh." Ed frowned. "Maybe it's just as well I never got that bond issue on the ballot last fall," he mused. "Even if it'd passed, I'd probably still have had to invest some of my own money for the Mr. Pig Museum and Family Fun Center."<br><br>Ed was referring to his harebrained scheme for an amusement park that would feature the Mr. Pig characters from a Japanese animated TV show that had been loosely based on his self-published autobiography, Mr. Ed.<br><br>"Yes," I agreed. "And it certainly would've been a lot of work." Work. It was a word with which Ed had only a passing acquaintance, as I'd learned to my sorrow when I inherited him from the Advocate's previous owner, Marius Vandeventer.<br><br>"So what about it?" he asked, burying his chins deeper into his muffler. "I mean . . . that is . . . what's the chance of getting my old job back?"<br><br>I grimaced. "We have an ad manager, Ed. Leo Walsh has done an outstanding job ever since you quit."<br><br>Ed looked at me as if I were dumb as a rope. "Emma, Emma," he said in a condescending tone, "Leo came here from California. Southern California," he added, emphasizing the part of the state to make it sound even worse, like having pulmonary pneumonia instead of simple bronchitis. "I'm an Alpine native. Who knows commerce around here better than I do? Who hobnobs with all the business and civic leaders? Who plays golf with Mayor Baugh?"<br><br>I honestly didn't know what to say--except, of course, to refuse Ed's request to return to work. "Why didn't you run for county commissioner in November?"<br><br>Ed grimaced. "I missed the filing deadline." He paused and looked away. "And I forgot there was a fee, even for a write-in candidate."<br><br>I'd known that, of course, but I wanted to hear Ed admit it. "That's too bad," I said. "You could have added something to the board." I was sincere. Our trio of doddering old coots should have been voted out of office long before, but nobody sane enough to replace them had ever offered any opposition. Even Ed would have been an improvement. At least he didn't drool at meetings.<br><br>But I had to deal with reality. "Have you any income?" I asked.<br><br>Ed looked wistful. "A little. Not enough to cover the mortgage and everything else."<br><br>I nodded sympathetically. "Given your close association with the business community, surely you can find a job."<br><br>Ed bridled. "Not just any job! Not after what I've been . . ." He leaned forward, his stomach pressing against my desk. "I'm an ad man. I'm not an auto mechanic or a building contractor or anything like that. I need to do what I've always done."<br><br>And done halfheartedly, I thought. I sighed. "I simply can't replace Leo. He's earned his keep."<br><br>Leaning back in the chair, Ed jiggled one leg up and down. "Right. I understand. Okay." The chair creaked under his weight. "If . . . never mind." He got to his feet, huffing and puffing a little. "I never thought I'd have to put my kids to work."<br><br>"Why not?" I said. "They should work. They're old enough except for the two youngest. Jobs would be good for them. They need to take responsibility."<br><br>Ed shuddered. "They won't like it."<br><br>I was tempted to say that was a hereditary trait, but it would have been cruel to kick Ed when he seemed down. My phone rang. I hesitated in answering it, but Ed waved a hand.<br><br>"Go ahead. I'm out of here." He opened the door to the newsroom. The last I saw of him was a mound of cashmere overcoat scurrying past Vida's desk.<br><br>The call was from my brother, Ben, who was still in town after spending the holidays with me. On Christmas Eve day he'd driven over two thousand miles in two and a half days from his temporary parish in East Lansing, Michigan, and he was taking an extra week's vacation after New Year's. My son, Adam, who is also a priest, had come down from St. Mary's Igloo in Alaska December 19 but had to go back to his ice-bound outpost on the third. Adam had stayed with me; Ben was bunking at St. Mildred's rectory.<br><br>"Sluggly," Ben said, using his childhood nickname for me, "who's Anna Maria Della Croce?"<br><br>The name rang only the faintest of bells. "Am I supposed to know?"<br><br>"Den's not here this morning," Ben said, referring to St. Mildred's pastor, Dennis Kelly. "Remember, he was taking a long weekend in Seattle to recover from all the Advent and Christmas hoo-hah."<br><br>"Oh, right." I saw Vida's imposing figure heading in my direction. "Anna Maria what?"<br><br>Ben spelled her last name. "She called the parish office at seven this morning, asking for Den. I thought she said Ben, so I got her confused."<br><br>The confusion was understandable, since my brother had filled in for Father Den during his six-month sabbatical. "What about it?" I asked as Vida stood behind the visitor's chair that Ed had recently vacated.<br><br>"She started telling me her troubles as if I should know," Ben went on, "and I finally figured out she thought I was Kelly. I don't recall her from the six months I served here, and I couldn't find her in the parish directory file. She needs to talk to Den, not me."<br><br>I looked up at Vida, whose face was puckered with curiosity. "Does the name Anna Maria Della Croce mean anything to you?"<br><br>Vida repeated the name several times, very fast. "It should." She frowned. "Really, I can't place her. Are you sure she lives in Alpine?"<br><br>I started to relay the message to Ben, but Vida's trumpetlike voice already had reached his ear.<br><br>"If Vida doesn't know her," Ben said dryly, "nobody does."<br><br>My brother was right. Vida was the font of all knowledge in Alpine, having been born and raised in the small logging town some seventy years earlier.<br><br>"Did she give you a local phone number or address?" I asked.<br><br>"Yes," Ben replied. "A number, that is."<br><br>"Is her situation dire?" I inquired as Vida leaned over my desk to try to hear Ben on the other end of the line.<br><br>"No. Naturally, I can't tell you what the problem is even if it's not under the seal of confession," Ben said. "Anyway, she rattled on like a steam engine, and I'm not sure what she was talking about, except that it's something she seems to have discussed with Kelly. Got to go. I have to take Holy Communion to a couple of sick people at the nursing home."<br><br>"Well?" Vida said after I'd hung up. She was leaning on the desk with both hands, and her felt hat with the feather looked like something left over from a B movie version of The Three Musketeers. "What's going on with that ninny Ed? He wouldn't even talk to me just now."<br><br>It was useless to keep information from Vida. She'd find out eventually, even if she had to tap every one of her considerable resources. "He says he's broke. I gather he's been doing some investing on his own and it hasn't turned out well."<br><br>"Of course not." Vida sat down. "So foolish. But I'm hardly surprised. Why doesn't he sell that ridiculous house of his?"<br><br>"Who'd buy it?" Casa de Bronska was an Italian-style villa that Ed and Shirley had built at the east end of town above the river and the railroad tracks. It was complete with swimming pool, marble statuary, and Tuscan tiles featuring likenesses of the Bronsky family and their dog, Carhop. "There's no market for that kind of house in Alpine."<br><br>"True," Vida allowed. "So silly to have such a house around here. The only thing it's fit for is some kind of retreat center, or perhaps an inn."<br><br>"That's not a bad idea," I said. "You should suggest that to Ed."<br><br>Vida shot me a disgusted look. "He wouldn't listen to good sense. That's undoubtedly how he got himself into this mess in the first place."<br><br>"I'm afraid so," I admitted, and paused. "He wanted his old job back."<br><br>Vida's jaw dropped. "No! What nerve! Leo can be aggravating, especially when he smokes, but he's ten times the ad manager Ed ever was. I hope you told him no."<br><br>I nodded. "I wouldn't jeopardize Leo for the world, and certainly not for Ed Bronsky."<br><br>"Honestly." Vida thought for a moment, shaking her head and folding her arms across her jutting bosom. "Who is this Anna Maria person? I'm trying to remember where I've heard the name. There aren't that many Italian families in town."<br><br>I shrugged. "Father Den will know when he gets back tomorrow. From what I gathered, whoever she is, she's not standing on a chair with a noose around her neck."<br><br>"I've no patience with people who do that sort of thing," Vida declared. "So selfish, to the very end." She turned as our office manager, Ginny Erlandson, came into the newsroom with the mail. "I should see what's piled up over the weekend." Vida rose and walked in her splayfooted manner to her desk.<br><br>As usual, Ginny delivered my batch first; it was one of the few perks I had as the Advocate's editor and publisher.<br><br>"It looks like the usual," she said, putting the stack into my in-basket. "PR and news releases, ads, and a couple of bills."<br><br>"Nobody does much between Christmas and New Year's," I noted. "How was your weekend?"<br><br>"Fine," Ginny replied. "We took the boys up to the summit so they could go sledding. It's so weird not having snow in Alpine this time of year."<br><br>It was weird. The Pacific Northwest was suffering from drought. While it might be convenient to not have to dig out from under a couple of feet of snow during the winter, the freezing level in the Cascades had receded above Alpine's three-thousand-foot altitude. Despite the off-and-on-again rainfall, the lack of snow meant there would be no reserve come spring and summer. I'd written a couple of editorials on the subject, but Mother Nature didn't subscribe to the Advocate.<br><br>"Your boys are getting so big," I remarked, sifting through the dross of mail in search of gold. Nothing even remotely glittered.<br><br>Ginny nodded, her single red braid bouncing over her shoulder. "They grow up so fast. Rick and I wonder if we should try for a girl."<br><br>It wasn't up to me to offer family planning advice. Over thirty years earlier, I'd given birth to Adam while not married. "You can't guarantee gender," I pointed out. "Vida had three girls."<br><br>"I know." Ginny gazed at the piece of mail that lay on top of the pile that still had to be delivered. "Vida's getting a shower invitation today from Julie Nelsen. I got one, too."<br><br>I tried to look pitiful. "Not me?"<br><br>Ginny, who is quite bright but lacks a sense of humor, looked embarrassed. "I didn't think you knew Julie."<br><br>I grinned, hoping Ginny would realize I was teasing her. "I don't. I mean, I know who she is. Julie works at Barton's Bootery. Her folks are Gustavsons, right? And she's married to . . ." I blanked.<br><br>"Nels Nelsen, from Index," Ginny said helpfully. "This is their first baby. They've been trying for years."<br><br>I decided not to say that they must be really worn-out. Ginny would take me literally. "That's nice. The Gustavsons are related to Vida, but I'm not sure how."<br><br>"Sometimes I think Vida's related to everybody in Alpine," Ginny declared. It wasn't much of an exaggeration. "She's amazing. I'd better take her the mail."<br><br>I polished off my share of the delivery in less than five minutes. The next day was the deadline for the weekly edition. I had no inspiration for an editorial. Maybe I could write a stirring piece asking our readers to donate money to a fund for the Bronsky family. I wondered how many of the locals would be gloating over Ed's decline and fall. I knew he'd rubbed a number of Alpiners the wrong way with his conspicuous consumption.<br><br>I strolled out into the newsroom, where Leo Walsh had just returned and was already on the phone. He gave me a high sign as I passed his desk on the way to the coffeemaker. My only reporter, Scott Chamoud, was scouring the streets for news. Or, I should say, street. Alpine had only one main east-west artery, which was where most of the local government and business offices were situated. Scott had had some news of his own before the holidays when he and his l...</p><h2>Montana&#39;s Indians: Yesterday and Today (Montana Geographic Series)</h2><p>Comprehensively describes Indians past and present on all seven Montana reservations, plus the Little Shell people. <p>From the book: This is a book about more than 50,000 people of Montana, many of whose ancestors called this country their home well before Lewis and Clark reached the mouth of the Yellowstone on the Missouri River. These people are the Indians of the Northern Plains and Columbia Plateau, who now happen to live primarily on the seven Montana reservations. </p><p>It was only 125 years ago that they hunted the buffalo in the Big Sky country. Today, through executive order and treaty, many live on reservations that have semi-sovereign legal status in relationship with the state of Montana and the United States government. </p><p>The subject of this book is not so much "the Indians of Montana," but rather tribes of people native to Montana who like to be thought of as Assiniboine, Sioux, Gros Ventre, Kootenai, Salish, Blackfeet, Cree, Northern Cheyenne, Crow, and Chippawa. George Snell, an Assiniboine tribal leader, put it simply: "The non-Indian has a way of lumping us all together, and I don't like it. Blacks don't like to be lumped with the Spanish, and Irish don't like to be be lumped with the English, so why does everybody have to call us Indian?"</p></p><p></p><h2>Astrology Really Works!</h2><p>The Magi Society offers convincing arguments as to the reasons why certain companies and individuals are so successful.

Engels paints an unforgettable picture of daily life in the new industrial towns, and for miners and agricultural workers--depicting overcrowded housing, abject poverty, child labour, sexual exploitation, dirt and drunkenness--in a savage indictment of the greed of the bourgeoisie. His fascinating later preface, written for the first English edition of 1892 and included here, brought the story up to date in the light of forty years&#39; further refelection. A masterpiece of committed reporting and an impassioned call to arms, this is one of the great pioneering works of social history.</p><p>Frederick Engels (1820-1895), the son of a wealthy German textile manufacturer, moved in 1842 to England to take a position in a factory near Manchester partially owned by his father. Engels met Karl Marx in 1844 and began a lifelong association with him. The two are considered to be the founders of modern communism. The Condition of the Working Class in England (1845; English translation 1847) is one of the classic texts of Marxist thought, standing besides such other of Engels&#39; works as Socialism: Utopian and Scientific and The Dialectic of Nature. It is a vitally important political, social and historical document.Tristram Hunt is one of Britain&#39;s best-known historians.

His world is made up of hard evidence and uncontestable facts, his observations and conclusions unsullied by personal feelings, until novelist Cullin goes behind the cold, unsentimental surface to reveal for the first time the inner world of an obsessively private man.<br><br>It is 1947, and the long-retired Holmes, now 93, lives in a remote Sussex farmhouse, where his memories and intellect begin to go adrift. He lives with a housekeeper and her young son, Roger, whose patient, respectful demeanor stirs paternal affection in Holmes. Holmes has settled into the routine of tending his apiary, writing in journals, and grappling with the diminishing powers of his razor-sharp mind, when Roger comes upon a case hitherto unknown. It is that of a Mrs. Keller, the long-ago object of Holmes&#x2019;s deep&#x2014;and never acknowledged&#x2014;infatuation. <br><br>As Mitch Cullin weaves together Holmes&#x2019;s hidden past, his poignant struggle to retain mental acuity, and his unlikely relationship with Roger, Holmes is transformed from the machine-like, mythic figure into an ordinary man, confronting and acquiescing to emotions he has resisted his entire life. This subtle and wise work is more than just a reimagining of a classic character. It is a profound meditation on faultiness of memory and how, as we grow older, the way we see the world is inevitably altered.</p><p>Long after Sir Arthur Conan Doyle allowed him to retire to Sussex to take up beekeeping, there seems to be no end of enthusiasm for imagined versions of the life of Sherlock Holmes. There was Michael Chabon's <i>The Final Solution</i> in which "the old man," an 89-year-old beekeeper in Sussex is undoubtedly Holmes. Laurie King, a fine mystery writer, has appropriated Holmes and created a romance between him and young Mary Russell which has lasted through several enjoyable books. And now, nonagenarian Holmes reappears, most appealingly, in Mitch Cullin's <i>A Slight Trick of the Mind.</i> He is frail and forgetful but still observant and capable of shining the bright light of his insight and brilliance on events both past and present.<p> Cullin has carefully woven three stories together and managed it so neatly that no threads show--worthy of Holmes himself. The first is the story of Holmes's recent return from a trip to Japan, ostensibly in search of prickly ash, a bush that he believes contributes to healthy longevity, as does his beloved and trusted royal jelly. While there, he is met by his correspondent, Mr. Umezaki, who isn't as interested in prickly ash as in gleaning information from Holmes about his long-gone father. Supposedly, they met many years before, in London, and Holmes advised him not to return home. Of course, Holmes has no recollection of the meeting but finesses it nicely.</p><p> It is 1947 when they visit Hiroshima, post-atomic bomb, and Holmes marvels at what he sees. He compares it, most poignantly, to the loss of the queen in a hive, "when no resources were available to raise a new one. Yet how could he explain the deeper illness of unexpressed desolation, that imprecise pall harbored en masse by ordinary Japanese?" That is what he tells Roger, the 14-year-old son of his housekeeper. Roger is the second thread of the novel. Holmes is introducing him to beekeeping and Roger proves an apt student. His hero-worship of Holmes and his need for a father form an integral part of Cullin's intention of "humanizing" the great Sherlock Holmes.</p><p> The final thread is revealed in a journal that Holmes kept, in which he entered an encounter with a married woman, many years ago. He is infatuated with her, and hardly knows what to call it or what to make of his feelings. This is unfamiliar territory for the man who is rational above all else.

He shows how social changes - the Industrial Revolution, advances in education, increased wealth and leisure - led to the kit toys, tournament toys, organized play, and toy marketing of today. Contemporary issues such as toy safety, "boy" toys versus "girl" toys, and toys and violence are here too - along with the homemade slingshots, road tar gum, and cucumber "poopie" dolls of a less self-conscious era. The playthings of childhood are "us," and if we look carefully, as McClary shows, we can read in them our own history.</p><p>Andrew McClary is Professor Emeritus of Natural Science, Michigan State University.An extensive and well-documented history of American toys over the past 100 years. Separate chapters are devoted to the histories of tops, marbles, propeller toys, noisemakers, hoops, dolls, shooters, and blocks. ``Toys have always been sexist,'' McClary states, with boys owning about two-thirds of all toys sold. Toy fads have increased over the years to ``appear from nowhere as instant favorites,'' e.g., Barbie dolls, G.I. Joes, Hula Hoops, yo- yos, slinkys, teddy bears, Cabbage Patch Kids, Super Soakers, etc. Readers are sure to enjoy the copious black-and-white illustrations and photographs of toys throughout--many from books and magazines from the turn of the century--as well as the wealth of primary source materials, with excerpts from memoirs and letters about growing up in rural America and what games and toys were enjoyed then. McClary uses sophisticated language and ideas, but supports them with anecdotes and a warm tone that draws readers into the pages. His well-researched and focused treatment will inspire reports about the spirit of childhood--for toys allow ``a child to be a child and have fun.''

Yet both are deeply rooted in the inner workings of the human brain. With the advent of the modern cognitive neurosciences, the scientific study of religious and spiritual phenomena has become far more sophisticated and wide-ranging. What might brain scans of people in prayer, in meditation, or under the influence of psychoactive substances teach us about religious and spiritual beliefs? Are religion and spirituality reducible to neurological processes, or might there be aspects that, at least for now, transcend scientific claims?<br><br>In this book, Andrew Newberg explores the latest findings of neurotheology, the multidisciplinary field linking neuroscience with religious and spiritual phenomena. He investigates some of the most controversial&#x2015;and potentially transformative&#x2015;implications of a neurotheological approach for the truth claims of religion and our understanding of minds and brains. Newberg leads readers on a tour through key intersections of neuroscience and theology, including the potential evolutionary basis of religion; the psychology of religion, including mental health and brain pathology; the neuroscience of myths, rituals, and mystical experiences; how studies of altered states of consciousness shed new light on the mind-brain relationship; and what neurotheology can tell us about free will. When brain science and religious experience are considered together in an integrated approach, Newberg shows, we might come closer to a fuller understanding of the deepest questions.</p><p>Andrew Newberg is the director of research at the Marcus Institute of Integrative Health at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. His books include <i>Why God Won&#x2019;t Go Away: Brain Science and the Biology of Belief</i> (2001), <i>Why We Believe What We Believe: Uncovering Our Biological Need for Meaning, Spirituality, and Truth</i> (2006), <i>How God Changes Your Brain: Breakthrough Findings from a Leading Neuroscientist</i> (2009), and <i>Principles of Neurotheology</i> (2010).A tour de force in this emerging field, <i>Neurotheology</i> provides a superb review of the science to date and shows the many directions the field may go in the future. This book raises profound implications for neuroscience, medicine, theology, and philosophy. Fascinating and clearly written and accessible for everyone. Truly mind-blowing. (Harold Koenig, Duke University Medical Center)<br><br>This book offers the promise that &#x2018;neurotheology&#x2019; can help move us beyond the conflict between science and religion toward the truth or at least to a more unified and universal perspective on the interface between spirituality and the brain. <i>Neurotheology</i> covers many potential points of contact between science and religion, acknowledges the existence of complexity and the dangers of simple reductionism, and presents clear information on the capabilities and limitations of various forms of neurological assessment. (John Peteet, Harvard Medical School)<br><br>In <i>Neurotheology</i>, Andrew Newberg discusses the possibility of a fruitful dialogue between neuroscience and religion and how this sort of investigation may have a profound impact on how we see spirituality, ourselves, and life. A world expert in the neuroimaging study of spiritual experiences, Newberg proposes a nondogmatic approach to the scientific study of spirituality and successfully advocates for fruitful exchanges between science and religion. (Alexander Moreira-Almeida, Federal University of Juiz de Fora)<br><br>A magnificent work! Newberg is a superb scientist, yet still writes for a curious reader or college student an entirely gripping scholarly account. He addresses some of humanity's all-time epic questions of ultimate meaning with systematic, fine grain research that could only be technically possible in the past decade. A true work of scholarship, with rigor, artful synthesis, and a deep bench of knowledge around spirituality and religion. (Lisa Miller, Ph.D., Professor and Founder, Spirituality Mind Body Institute, Teachers College, Columbia University)<br><br>[A] comprehensive look at the field of neurotheology, or the neurology of religion. . . . Given that the larger relationship between science and religion has been contested for centuries, Newberg&#x2019;s latest evidential support for a scientific understanding of why humans practice religion will be a welcome overview for interested readers. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Newberg's book will be of most value to those who are struggling to reconcile science and spirituality. (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>This is an excellent introduction to the emerging field of neurotheology as well as a concise assessment of the contributions of neuroscience to our understanding of a broad range of religious and spiritual issues.

She was the original and ultimate California girl of the early seventies, complete with stick-straight hair, a laid-back style, and a red convertible. But Lipton was much more: smart and determined to not be just another leggy blonde, she struggled for a way to stay connected to her childhood roots, though her coming of age had not been an easy one. And when she fell in love with Quincy Jones, that wasn't easy, either: their biracial marriage made headlines and changed her life. <br><br>Lipton's passionate and complicated seventeen-year marriage to Jones plunged her into motherhood and also into periods of confusion and difficulty. Her struggle to keep moving forward in the world while maintaining a rich inner life informed many of her decisions as an adult. When Lipton's marriage to Jones ended, she returned to television, appearing in David Lynch's <i>Twin Peaks</i> as well as in <i>The Vagina Monologues</i> and other stage productions.

Like her mother, young Sarah Carrier is bright and willful, openly challenging the small, brutal world in which they live. Often at odds with one another, mother and daughter are forced to stand together against the escalating hysteria of the trials and the superstitious tyranny that led to the torture and imprisonment of more than 200 people accused of witchcraft. This is the story of Martha's courageous defiance and ultimate death, as told by the daughter who survived.<br>Kathleen Kent is a tenth generation descendent of Martha Carrier. She paints a haunting portrait, not just of Puritan New England, but also of one family's deep and abiding love in the face of fear and persecution.</p><p>Kathleen Kent lives in Dallas with her husband and son. THE HERETIC&#39;S DAUGHTER is her first novel.Mare Winningham starts by expressing young Sarah Carrier&#39;s dislike for her harsh mother and stern father. Then a pox comes to their late-seventeenth-century farm near Salem, Massachusetts, and Sarah is removed to the lively home of her aunt. Winningham lets us hear the tenderness in Sarah&#39;s voice as she warms to cheerier surroundings. Winningham&#39;s portrayal of Sarah&#39;s hostility on homecoming is sharpened with preadolescent indignation and judgment. Gradually, Winningham&#39;s tones change as Sarah becomes bitter and protective when her mother is accused of witchcraft. Powerful descriptions of 9-year-old Sarah&#39;s time in prison are depicted well by the fear, anger, and repulsion Winningham projects into her reading. Author Kent, a tenth-generation descendent of Martha Carrier, who was hanged as a witch in 1692, has an accurate vision for time and place, equaled by Winningham&#39;s narration. S.W.

Based on newly discovered manuscript materials, this book seeks to explain how and why.</p><p>In these documents&#x2015;marked by Robert Todd Lincoln as the "MTL Insanity File"&#x2015;exists the only definitive record of the tragic story of Mary Todd Lincoln&#x2019;s insanity trial. The book that results from these letters and documents addresses several areas of controversy in the life of the widow of Abraham Lincoln: the extent of her illness, the fairness of her trial, and the motives of those who had her committed for treatment. Related issues include the status of women under the law as well as the legal and medical treatment of insanity.</p><p>Speculating on the reasons for her mental condition, the authors note that Mrs. Lincoln suffered an extraordinary amount of tragedy in a relatively few years. Three of her four sons died very young, and Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. After the death of her son Willie she maintained a darkly rigorous mourning for nearly three years, prompting the president to warn her that excessive woe might force him to send her to "that large white house on the hill yonder," the government hospital for the insane.</p><p>Mrs. Lincoln also suffered anxiety about money, charting an exceptionally erratic financial course. She had spent lavishly during her husband&#x2019;s presidency and at his death found herself deeply in debt. She had purchased trunkfuls of drapes to hang over phantom windows. 84 pairs of kid gloves in less than a month, and $3,200 worth of jewelry in the three months preceding Lincoln&#x2019;s assassination. She followed the same erratic course for the rest of her life, creating in herself a tremendous anxiety. She occasionally feared that people were trying to kill her, and in 1873 she told her doctor that an Indian spirit was removing wires from her eyes and bones from her cheeks.</p><p>Her son assembled an army of lawyers and medical experts who would swear in court that Mrs. Lincoln was insane. The jury found her insane and in need of treatment in an asylum. Whether the verdict was correct or not, the trial made Mary Lincoln desperate. Within hours of the verdict she would attempt suicide. In a few months she would contemplate murder. Since then every aspect of the trial has been criticized&#x2015;from the defense attorney to the laws in force at the time. Neely and McMurtry deal with the trial, the commitment of Mary Todd Lincoln, her release, and her second trial. An appendix features letters and fragments by Mrs. Lincoln from the "Insanity File." The book is illustrated by 25 photographs. </p></p><p><p><b>Mark E.

Like many modern artists, specifically Pablo Picasso, Lam participated in the primitivist movement, drawing inspiration and imagery from non-western, pre-technological cultures. Yet, unlike European and Euroamerican primitivists, Lam, who was a Cuban of Spanish, African, and Chinese descent, was engaging with his own cultural heritage in his works. His authenticity as both "primitive" and "primitivist" challenges the fundamental tenets of primitivism and makes Lam an ambiguous, fascinating figure in twentieth-century art.</p> <p>This wide-ranging study explores Lam's enduring contribution to world art history&#x2014;the reclamation and projection of an African identity within mainstream art. Lowery Stokes Sims surveys Lam's work, focusing on the period from 1947 onwards, in which he demonstrated the viability of nationalist pursuits within modernism to a new generation of artists. She traces his career and life and the critical reception of his work in Cuba and Latin America, the United States, and Europe as each locale predominated in his career.</p> <p>This masterly assessment of Lam's later work demonstrates the evolution of primitivist concepts in modern art from the specifically ethnographic to the more psychic and existential. What emerges from Lam's story is the fate of Surrealism in the postwar era as it permutated into international artistic movements such as the CoBrA, the Group Phases, and the International Situationists.</p></p><p>Lowery Stokes Sims is Executive Director of the Studio Museum in Harlem.This monograph offers an unprecedented opportunity to reconsider Wilfredo Lam's (1902-82) work and sphere of influence after 1947, a period of productivity traditionally relegated to footnote status in previous analyses of his career. The study contemplates his late-career work in relation to his early development, from his 15-year sojourn in Madrid, to his close relationship with Picasso and the surrealist luminaries in Paris, to his turn from European simulated exoticism toward an authentic cultural lexicon that fed the political activism of traditionally marginalized Cuban Africans. The book also serves as a valuable window into the complexities of exile culture, as Lam's lengthy stay in and subsequent flight from Europe ultimately had profound generative effects on both his own work and the course of modern art. Executive director of the Studio Museum in Harlem, Sims (Stuart Davis) demonstrates Lam's international legacy, revealing his participation in or influence on the European and American avant-garde movements in subsequent decades. Sims considers the fate of Primitivism and Surrealism after World War II and evaluates the significance of Lam's work for the story of modern art.

(Jeb) Stuart. And none played a more prominent role during the brief period when the hopes of the nascent Confederacy were at their apex, when it appeared as though the Army of Northern Virginia could not be restrained from establishing Southern nationhood.<br><br>Jeb Stuart was not only successful in leading Robert E. Lee&#x2019;s cavalry in dozens of campaigns and raids, but for riding magnificent horses, dressing outlandishly, and participating in balls and parties that epitomized the &#x201c;moonlight and magnolia&#x201d; image of the Old South. Longstreet reported that at the height of the Battle of Second Manasses, Stuart rode off singing, &#x201c;If you want to have good time, jine the cavalry . . .&#x201d; Porter Alexander remembered him singing, in the midst of the miraculous victory at Chancellorsville, &#x201c;Old Joe Hooker, won&#x2019;t you come out of the Wilderness?&#x201d;<br><br>Stuart was blessed with an unusually positive personality&#x2014;always upbeat, charming, boisterous, and humorous, remembered as the only man who could make Stonewall Jackson laugh, reciting poetry when not engaged in battle, and yet never using alcohol or other stimulants. Year of Glory focuses on the twelve months in which Stuart&#x2019;s reputation was made, following his career on an almost day-to-day basis from June 1862, when Lee took command of the army, to June 1863, when Stuart turned north to regain a glory slightly tarnished at Brandy Station, but found Gettysburg instead. <br><br>It is told through the eyes of the men who rode with him, as well as Jeb&#x2019;s letters, reports, and anecdotes handed down over 150 years. It was a year like no other, filled with exhilaration at the imminent creation of a new country. This was a period when it could hardly be imagined that the cause, and Stuart himself, could dissolve into grief, Jeb ultimately separated from the people he cherished most.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>FOREWORD BY STEPHEN W.

She has illustrated the work of outstanding authors such as Jane Yolen, Laurence Yep and Jacquelyn Mitchard, and has published over a half dozen books of her own. She enjoys living near the beach and being with her family, as well as painting and writing.This tender Nativity story begins with the birth of Jesus and ends with the Holy Family leaving the stable. In succeeding pages, a patterned text focuses on one aspect of the baby (his fingers or mouth, for example) and then shows Jesus as an adult using his fingers as a carpenter or his mouth in speaking and teaching. The rhyming text is gentle and soothing, even while showing the adult Jesus at the Last Supper and in the Garden of Gethsemane. The poetic story will be accessible to very young children, though they will need some assistance from an adult in understanding the nonlinear structure of the text. Noonan's illustrations use soft colors that complement the style of the text, with many appealing views of Baby Jesus and his parents on the first Christmas Day.

It's this "soft realism" approach to colored pencil that Ann Kullburg shares in her insightful new technique book. <p>Kullberg teaches artists how to faithfully capture the essence of any subject without wasting time on excessive detail work. Step by step she presents 35 popular subjects and describes techniques for adding rich texture, depth and form in the most simple and straightforward way possible. Insights on getting a realistic effect include: � Mapping out a complex subject to make it easier to paint � Changing pencil strokes to create different textures � Mixing hues for greater visual interest � Creating softer, more natural edges by varying the pressure of the pencil It's all the instruction a colored pencil artist needs to effortlessly add gorgeous details to every piece they create.</p></p><p>Ann Kullberg is the author of Colored Pencil Portraits Step by Step. She is a popular colored pencil workshop instructor and is also an active and honored member of the Colored Pencil Society of America. She lives in Federal Way, Washington.An accomplished portrait artist and author, Kullberg begins her book in a defensive tone. Why, she asks, write a book about the details of hedges, apple blossoms, striped couches, and keyholes-the things that fill in the background and foreground of portraits? It's clear, though, that any artist will advance his or her colored pencil technique immeasurably through this book. The use of reference photos, demonstrations of feathering vs. definite strokes and the dense vs. airy approach, and excellent "Frequently Asked Questions" boxes all make for a significant contribution to the teaching of this style of drawing. This is a fine advance for students who have mastered Bet Borgeson's Basic Colored Pencil Techniques. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Consider the Lilies</h2><p>&#x2018;Retrained, finely wrought ...

In this novel Iain Crichton Smith captures the impact of the Highland Clearances through the thoughts and memories of an old woman who has lived all her life within the narrow confines of her community. Alone and bewildered by the demands of the factor, Mrs Scott approaches the minister for help, only to have her faith shattered by his hypocrisy. She finds comfort, however, from a surprising source: Donald Macleod, an imaginative and self-educated man who has been ostracised by his neighbours, not least by Mrs Scott herself, on account of his atheism. Through him and through the circumstances forced upon her, the old woman achieves new strength.</p><p>Iain Crichton Smith was one of the best-loved and most prolific Scottish authors of the twentieth century.

These qualities were often subordinated to the need for the strongest possible anti-apartheid statement in his acclaimed book House of Bondage, published in 1967. Many of the photographs have never been published before and others, which were cropped in the book for their maximum political effect, will now be seen un-cropped for the first time. Ernest Cole the Photographer accompanies an exhibition with the same title, produced by the Hasselblad Foundation. Ernest Cole, born 1940 in Eersterust, South Africa, started working as an assistant at Drum magazine in 1958. As a freelance photographer he began his seminal essay on what it meant to be black under apartheid in 1959. In 1966 he left his country with the dream of making a book that he knew was impossible to do in South Africa. House of Bondage, published in 1967, was immediately banned in South Africa, and so was he.

The coincidence is appropriate: although Heidegger's is a conspicuously abstract philosophy, delivered in a language whose enigmas often defeat interpretation, it is firmly 'grounded' (one of Heidegger's favourite terms) in its time and circumstances.<br>Heidegger was a private supporter of Nazism from its inception, and in the 1930s made public his personal belief, pronouncing his support for Hitler. But Heidegger was not only a Nazi in his political affiliation: he believed his philosophy to be the spiritual parallel to Hitler's leadership. In 1933 he was made Rektor of Freiburg University, a position which he hoped would enable him to put into practice his political and social views. He became one of the main instigators of the Nazification of German universities, encouraging students to participate in paramilitary exercises, and to salute him as if he were himself the Fuhrer. This was an aspect of the self-mythology to which he was prone: Hannah Arendt, his one-time pupil and lover, said his involvement with Nazism could be attributed 'partly to the delusion of genius, partly to desperation'. His political beliefs also deeply affected his closest personal and intellectual relationships. In the name of the Reich, he turned Gestapo informer, blackening 'un-German' professors as 'political unreliables', and, in an act of betrayal, he stood by as the regime expelled from Freiburg his mentor and friend, Edmund Husserl.<br>A profound influence on Sartre and other existentialists, acknowledged as a guiding inspiration by Foucault, defended by Derrida, Heidegger, since his death, has been and still is a major source of philosophical ideas for intellectuals both in Europe and in America. Hugo Ott's purpose in this scrupulously detailed and balanced biography is not to give his own explication of Heidegger's philosophy but to show that it is no longer possible to read it without considering the politics of its creator. In doing so Ott draws upon letters, archival material and the private papers of Heidegger, his friends, family and colleagues, in many cases for the first time, thereby fundamentally altering our understanding of him. In addition to its elucidation of the complicated but undeniable connections between Heidegger's life and thought, Ott's account is to be valued for the profound questions it raises about the responsibilities of intellectuals in the twentieth century.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: GermanAn exhaustive, fascinating examination of the controversial role played by Heidegger in the early years of the Nazi regime. Heidegger (1889-1976) has been regarded as one of the greatest German philosophers of the century--but controversy has swirled around his role in the betrayal of the German universities, particularly in 1933, when he was rector of the University of Freiburg (where author Ott teaches economic and social history). Ott's careful dissection of the archival evidence leaves little doubt that the philosopher aspired to transform the universities into Nazi institutions that he would then lead. Heidegger's writing, as well as his actions in a number of hitherto obscure episodes, suggests the degree of his commitment to Nazism: ``The F hrer himself and he alone is the German reality, present and future, and its law...Heil Hitler!'' So Heidegger said at Hitler's inauguration--but the Nazi Party, ready to use celebrities such as Heidegger but not willing to entrust them with any power, gave the leadership of the universities to reliable party mediocrities. With that rebuff, the philosopher's enthusiasm for Nazism seems to have ebbed, although, in the latter part of WW II, he was still telling a pupil that the only worthy life for a German was a life at the front. Ott admits that the view of Heidegger as Nazi hasn't gone unchallenged: Gerhard Ritter, a member of the 1944 bomb plot to kill Hitler, testified that the philosopher ``was secretly fiercely opposed to National Socialism after 30 June 1934....'' Such testimony, plus a number of passionate adherents helped to rescue Heidegger from the humiliations of the immediate postwar period, after which his reputation reached new heights. A curious combination of scholarship, exactness, and disorganization: a difficult but rewarding read for those not students of the period. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Mandy Searcy narrates the nuptial ceremony between her mother, who has five children, and Mr. Long, who has seven of his own. The wedding doesn't go as planned--how could it with 12 kids?--as horses, wagons, and kids take off through the countryside. The confusion and merriment is captured playfully with illustrations by Ted Rand and the wit of Faye Gibbons.Kindergarten-Grade 2?Melding "his" and "hers" into "ours" is never easy, so when Mama Searcy with her five red-headed children decides to marry Mr. Long with his seven brunettes, mutiny breaks out during the wedding ceremony. Add a swarm of bees to this volatile situation and you get...the perfect solution. The bees upset the mules hitched to a wagon of shared belongings, and as property mixes, so do the youngsters, resulting in a disheveled but somewhat harmonic crew. Told from the point of view of the oldest maternal daughter, the narrative is filled with regional and turn-of-the-century colloquialisms. Muted watercolor illustrations accurately convey both the soft, old-fashioned charm of Georgia mountain life and the impending insurrection. The artist pokes gentle fun at adults?Mr. Long's borrowed suit literally bursts at the seams; the minister and his wife are wonderful stereotypes. The endpapers show the "two scowling lines" of insubordinate offspring, and a smattering of bees across title pages foreshadow impending disaster. The large, two-spread format invites group sharing.

Indeed, the writing and rewriting of this endlessly intriguing icon's life has produced more than six hundred books, from the long procession of "authoritative" biographies to the memoirs and plays by ex-husband Arthur Miller and the works by Norman Mailer and Joyce Carol Oates. But even as the books have multiplied, myth, reality, fact, fiction, and gossip have become only more intertwined; there is still no agreement about such fundamental questions as Marilyn's given name, the identity of her father, whether she was molested as a child, and how and why she died.<br><br><i>The Many Lives of Marilyn Monroe</i> reviews the unreliable and unverifiable-but highly significant-stories that have framed the greatest Hollywood legend.

Take that from Satchmo! He was a born genius..."&#x2014;Louis ArmstrongBix Beiderbecke is one of jazz music&#x2019;s most enigmatic figures, and he has captivated listeners since his career began in the 1920s. He died at just 28, leaving many loose ends and inspiring much speculation. This book aims to clarify many of the myths created bythe musician's premature death and the fictionalizations of Bix's life (three novels and a film: "Remembering Bix" by Ralph Berton, "1929" by Fredericks W. Turner, and "Young Man with a Horn" by Dorothy Baker, and the 1950 film of Baker's novel by Michael Curtiz), and to update his two prior biographies ("Bix, Man and Legend" being out of print for many years). French jazz scholar Jean Pierre Lion traveled the trajectory of Bix&#x2019;s life, from birth to death, to boarding school, on tour and beyond, to find the true story of this pivotal figure.Considered a genius by his fans and fellow musicians, Bix Beiderbecke was a master cornet player, and one of the most inspiring white jazz musicians of his age. He drank heavily during Prohibition, and fell ill from the toxic swill he had been drinking. When he died he left behind a tremendous list of recordings (included here in a definitive discography) and several original compositions. This biography culls the entirety of Bix scholarship into one volume, painting a complete picture of the man, his music, and his times.Lion brings the true legend of Bix into historical context, underlining the importance of the jazz scene that Bix not only participated in, but also helped to establish. The originality of Bix&#x2019;s style has roots in New Orleans jazz and such classical composers as Debussy and Ravel, and this biography traces the evolution of these various inspirations alongside the tale of the white cornet player. Historical ambience is created by descriptions of the Chicago of the 1920s &#x2013; ruled by Al Capone and peopled with fast cars, flappers and hot jazz musicians &#x2013; and Bix&#x2019;s personality is fleshed out by excerpts from the few letters he wrote in his lifetime, and memories of friends and witnesses of the jazz-age.

(Well, sort of.)</p><p><b>ADAM REX</b> is the author and illustrator of <i>Frankenstein Makes a Sandwich, </i>a <i>New York Times Book Review </i>bestseller,<i> </i>and <i>Pssst!</i>, a Book Sense Autumn 2007 Top Ten Children&#x2019;s Pick and an Amazon.com Top 10 Editors&#x2019; Pick. He lives in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.<br>Grade 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;Rex returns with a sophisticated and stylish sequel to his sidesplitting <i>Frankenstein Makes a Sandwich</i> (Harcourt, 2006). From a stream of consciousness that seems to have retained and remixed an assemblage of horror movies, literature classes, comic strips, and observations of the human condition, the narrative flows despite multiple mediums and frequent interruptions. Children who have seen the 1935 <i>Bride of Frankenstein</i> will get the most out of the framing story, told initially in sequential panels and featuring the conically coiffed mate-to-be in a lively exchange with her mother over marrying someone with green skin and the looming wedding expenses coming just hours after the girl's funeral. Interspersed with the marital plot are blog posts from the Headless Horseman (exhibiting photographs of his decomposing head and the sensible canned substitute) and glimpses into Edgar Allan Poe's study, rendered in shadowy charcoals. These scenes are hilarious for students in the know. Rex channels the tortured poet's meter, internal rhyme scheme, and alliteration throughout his parody during which Poe struggles for the right choice in a crossword puzzle involving the wife of a "veep": "But what the devil is a veep?" he weeps, as lo, the clock strikes four. Quoth the raven, 'Tipper Gore.'" Godzilla haikus, a Peanuts-inspired Dracula Junior, endpapers that give the raven the last word-there's something here for the kid in everyone. This gifted artist, whose clever wordplay reveals a wonderfully warped sense of comedy, has whipped up another winner.&#x2014;<i>Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Destiny in the Desert was recently nominated for the Hessell-Tiltman History Prize.This superior history of the North African campaign argues persuasively that it was in fact a foundation stone of Allied victory, eventually making possible the attack on the southern flank of the European Axis and the reopening of the Mediterranean. The author, the son of a journalist who actually covered the campaign, does more than provide a detailed and absorbing history of the seesaw campaign across two thousand miles of sand and rock. He offers sketches of major figures, both military and civilian, worthy of a gifted novelist, as well as first-class battle narratives (although some may feel he scants the naval war, where the British holding the line was a necessary condition of victory). He also discusses the grand strategy, which shaped the campaign in the context of the divergent aims of the three major Allied powers&#x2014;the British wanting to keep Imperial communications, the Americans wanting an invasion of Europe, and Stalin wanting a second front anywhere that would get the Germans off his neck. A valuable addition to WWII collections of any size. --Roland Green</p><h2>Swing Changes: Big-Band Jazz in New Deal America</h2><p>Bands were playing, people were dancing, the music business was booming. It was the big-band era, and swing was giving a new shape and sound to American culture. In Swing Changes, David Stowe looks at New Deal America through its music and shows us how the contradictions and tensions within swing - over race, politics, its own cultural status, the role of women - mirrored those played out in the larger society. In its simultaneous acceptance and challenge of contemporary attitudes and stereotypes, swing reflected broader cultural impulses at the same time that it modified them.<br>Although its musical roots extended back to the 1920s, swing seemed to many to come out of nowhere in 1935, inspiring a welter of conflicting descriptions and explanations. Stowe explores this history to suggest why the music of Goodman and Ellington caught so many unawares, and why it fired so many - and so many different - imaginations when it emerged in full force. He links the music to the politics of the time, to prevailing ideas about race relations, and to the complex culture industry that was evolving in the 1930s. At its commercial apex in the early 1940s, swing was readily adapted to World War II, and Stowe reveals how the music served the cause as a symbol of national unity, even as this service worked to undermine the utopian values swing expressed. He follows the failure of swing to keep its unlikely cultural coalition together and describes the subsequent attempts of bebop to pick up where the big band left off. Drawing on memoirs, oral histories, newspapers, magazines, recordings, photographs, literature, and films, Swing Changes offers a vibrant picture of American society at a pivotal time, and a new perspective on music as a cultural force.</p><p>Bands were playing, people were dancing, the music business was booming.

In her later books, she almost reverses this process to show life as veiled and inconclusive, suggestive rather than definitive. The elliptical yet lucid craft of her poems presents experience as only imperfectly graspable. The poems ride lightly on the waves of thought, more textures than statements. Some readers have characterized Valentine as a "deep image" writer, but syntactically her work is more akin to the work of Mandelstam and Paul Celan than to that of Lorca and Neruda.<br><br>The Cradle of the Real Life is divided into two sections, the shorter first section dealing with loss and death and the longer second section, entitled "Her Lost Book," which weaves memories with various metaphors for writing, and deals specifically with the "problem" of women's writing. These finely wrought pieces take stark subject matter and make it shimmer; the poems take their shape as much from the absences as from the words, just as life is given meaning by the losses we survive.</p><p>5 1/2 x 8 1/2 trim.

The east wind brings hazes, smokes, the exhalation of the desert on the distant mainland; and hot winds come out of the south, across the wide ocean.The corn and tomatoes like the west wind. The tall corn gleams wet like cellophane, the tomato leaves pearl and bow down. The onions and garlic, on the other hand, get sullen and shreddy and threaten mold in the rain. Poor old cyborg with a few screws missing&#x2014;me&#x2014;sits watching them in fascination.When I find myself giving my vegetables personalities, it&#x2019;s a sign I&#x2019;ve been sitting here watching the rain too long. Or the bright ice. Or the hazes or the hot thin stripes of cloud. Accordingly then, I put on a coat or hat, depending on which way the wind is blowing, and walk out to have a look at the world.What I have of the world. When I rise, I can walk down the canyon to my brief stony beach to see if anything interesting has washed up there. Nothing ever has. Out on the rocks live sea lions, and they groan and howl so like old men that a mortal would be deceived. I ignore them.Or I can walk up the canyon and climb high narrow hills, through the ferny trees, until I stand on rimrock in the wind. I can look along the spine of my island in every direction. Ocean all around, the horizon vanishing in cloud. No ships ever, of course&#x2014;hominids haven&#x2019;t yet progressed beyond clinging to floating logs, when they venture to sea at all.And I begin my day. Much to do: the planting or the harvest, all the greenhouse work, the tasks of replacing irrigation pipes and cleaning out trenches. A little work on projects of my own, maybe planing wood to replace such of my furniture as has fallen apart with age. I take a meal, if I remember to. I wander back down to the beach in the evening, to watch the little waves run up on the shore, and sometimes I forget to go home.One day a small resort town will be built on this stony beach, palm trees and yellow sand brought in on barges, to make a place as artificial as I am. The water will be full of excursion boats, painted bright. Out there where that big rock is, the one that looks like a sugarloaf, a great ballroom will stand. I would dearly love to go dancing there, if he were with me.Sometimes I torment myself by walking along and imagining the crescent of street lined with shops and caf�s, gracious hotels. I can almost see the mortal children with their ice cream. I can almost hear the music. I sit down where there will be a terrace someday, complete with little tables and striped umbrellas. Sometimes a waiter has materialized at my elbow, white napkin over his arm, deferentially leaning from the waist to offer me a cocktail. He&#x2019;s never really there, of course, nor will he ever be.But the other man <i>will</i> be here, the one I see only in my dreams, or behind my eyes as I watch the quiet water in the long hours. I have waited for him, alone on this island, for three thousand years. I think.I&#x2019;m not certain, though, and this is the reason I have bound more paper into my book, vandalized another label printer cartridge, cut myself another pen: it may be that if I write things down I can keep track of the days. They have begun to float loose in an alarming way, like calendar leaves fluttering off the wall.I walked out this morning in the full expectation of thinning my tomato seedlings and&#x2014;imagine my stupefaction! Row upon row of big well-grown plants stretched away as far as the eye could see, heavy with scarlet fruit. Well-watered, weeded, cared for by someone. Me? I swear I can&#x2019;t recall, nor does my internal chronometer record any unusual forward movement; but something, my world or me, is slipping out of time&#x2019;s proper flow.What does it mean, such strangeness? Some slow deterioration of consciousness? Supposedly impossible in a perfectly designed immortal. But then, I&#x2019;m not quite mechanically sound, am I? I&#x2019;m a Crome generator, one of those aberrant creatures the mortals call psychic, or <i>second-sighted</i> . I&#x2019;m the only one on whom the Company ever conferred immortality, and I&#x2019;ll bet they&#x2019;re sorry now.Not that they meant to do it, of course. Somebody made a mistake when I was being evaluated for the honor of eternal service, didn&#x2019;t catch the latent flaw, and here I am like a stain in permanent ink. No way to erase me. Though marooning me at this station has undoubtedly solved a few problems for them.Yet my prison is actually a very nice place, quite the sort of spot I&#x2019;d choose to live, if I&#x2019;d ever had a choice: utterly isolated, beautifully green, silent in all its valleys and looming mountains, even the sea hushed where it breaks and jumps up white on the windward cliffs.Only one time was there ever noise, terrible sounds that echoed off the mountains. I hid indoors all that day, paced with my hands over my ears, hummed to myself to shut out the tumult. At least it was over in a few hours. I have never yet ventured back over into Silver Canyon to see if the little people there are all dead. I knew what would happen to them when I sent that signal, alerting Dr. Zeus to their presence. Were they refugees from Company persecution? Did I betray them? Well&#x2014;more blood on my soul. I was only following orders, of course.(Which is another reason I don&#x2019;t mind being an old field slave here, you see. Where else should I be? I&#x2019;ve been responsible for the deaths of seven mortal men and unknown numbers of whatever those little pale things were.)What the eyes can&#x2019;t see, the heart doesn&#x2019;t grieve over, isn&#x2019;t that what they say? And no eyes can see me here, that&#x2019;s for sure, if I generate the blue radiation that accompanies a fit of visions, or do some other scary and supposedly impossible thing like move through time spontaneously. I am far too dangerous to be allowed to run around loose, I know. Am I actually a <i>defective</i>? Will my fabulous cyborg super-intelligence begin to wane? It might be rather nice, creeping oblivion. Perhaps even death will become possible. But the Company has opted to hide me rather than study me, so there&#x2019;s no way to tell.I have done well, for a cast-off broken tool. Arriving, I crawled from my transport box with just about nothing but the prison uniform I wore. Now I have a comfortable if somewhat amateurish house I built myself, over long years, with a kitchen of which I am particularly proud. The fireplace draws nicely, and the little sink is supplied by a hand pump drawing on the well I drilled. I have a tin tub in my back garden, in which I bathe. Filled before midday heat rises, the water is reasonably warm by nightfall, and serves to water the lawn afterward. So very tidy, this life I&#x2019;ve built.Do I lack for food and drink? No indeed. I grow nearly everything I consume. About all I receive from the Company anymore are its shipments of Proteus brand synthetic protein.(Lately the Proteus only seems to come in the assortment packs, four flavors: Breakfast Bounty, Delicate and Savory, Hearty Fare, and Marina. The first two resemble pork and/or chicken or veal, and are comparatively inoffensive. I quite like Hearty Fare. It makes the best damned tamale filling I&#x2019;ve ever found. Marina, on the other hand, is an unfortunate attempt to simulate seafood. It goes straight into my compost heap, where it most alarmingly fails to decompose. There has been no response to my requests for a change, but this is a prison, after all.)Have I written that before, about the Proteus? I have a profound sense of d�j� vu reading it over, and paused just now to thumb back through the book to see if I was duplicating a previous entry. No. Nothing in the first part, about England, and nothing in the afterword I wrote on my trial transcript. More of this slipping time business. Nothing has again been so bad as that day I paused in weeding to wipe my sweating face and looked up to see the row just cleared full of weeds again, and the corn a full foot taller than it had been a moment before. But nothing else out of whack! No sign of dust or cobwebs in my house, no conflicting chronometers.Yes, I really must try to anchor myself here and now. It may be a bit late for mental health, but at least I might keep from sinking into the rock of this island, buried under centuries, preserved like a fossil in a strata of unopened Proteus Marina packets. I suppose it wouldn&#x2019;t have come to this pass if I&#x2019;d seen another living soul in three thousand years who wasn&#x2019;t a dream or a hallucination.If only he&#x2019;d come for me.<br>I don&#x2019;t know if I should write about him. The last time I did that I was depressed for years, roamed this island in restless misery end to end. Not a good thing to summon up a ghost when you&#x2019;re all alone, especially when you&#x2019;d sell your soul&#x2014;if you had one&#x2014;to join him in his long grave. But then, perhaps misery is what&#x2019;s needed to fasten me securely to the world. Perhaps this curiously painless existence is the problem.If I look across the table I can see him standing there, as I saw him first in England in 1554: a tall mortal in the black robe of a scholar, staring at me in cold and arrogant dislike. We weren&#x2019;t enemies long. I was very young and so fascinated by the mortal&#x2019;s voice, and his fine big hands ... I wake at night sometimes, convinced I can feel his mortal flesh at my side, hot as the fire in which he was martyred.So I look away: but there he is in the doorway, just as he stood in the doorway of the stagecoach inn in the Cahuenga Pass, when he walked back into my life in 1863. He was smiling then, a Victorian gentleman in a tall hat, sm...</p><h2>Doctor Who: The Day She Saved the Doctor</h2><p>Four fantastic new adventures with the Doctor, starring Rose, SarahJane, Clara and Bill, publishing on International Women's Day in March 2018.<br> <br>Written by Jenny Colgan, Jacqueline Rayner, Dorothy Koomson and Susan Calman, these stories are a celebration of the Doctor's fantastic female friends, packed with heroic action and heart for fans of all age<br><br>Includes the following stories:<br><br>� <b>SARAH JANE AND THE TEMPLE OF EYES</b>........................BY JACQUELINE RAYNER<br>� <b>ROSE AND THE SNOW WINDOW</b>...........................................BY JENNY T.

Such are the central subjects of Paula Fox's enthralling <i>Desperate Characters</i>, first published to much acclaim in 1970. The novel's action unfolds in a single weekend, and includes Otto's torturous breakup with his longtime business partner, Charlie, and a visit the Bentwoods make to their country home, which they find vandalized. Everything pivots around an occurrence so ordinary as to make us marvel at the power it wields under Fox's brilliant pressure: a cat bite. <p> Despite Otto's protests, Sophie puts out a dish for a stray that roams the Bentwoods' neighborhood--an area which is also home to enormous poverty, and in which they, in their renovated townhouse, sit like distant royalty. The cat sinks its teeth into her hand and instantly we are plunged into the heart of what plagues every aspect of this couple's lives: the threat of rabies. Where the cat is concerned, it's literal rabies, but the book is also steeped in the sense that a kind of social rabies lurks just outside the Bentwoods' and indeed the whole world's door. As Sophie suddenly realizes at one point: "Ticking away inside the carapace of ordinary life and its sketchy agreements was anarchy." </p><p> Throughout Fox's gorgeously crafted, unflinching portrait of a dying marriage and a country at war with itself, the Bentwoods fight the desire to self-destruct like everything around them. At one point, Otto screams at Sophie: "What in God's name do you want? Do you want Charlie to murder me? Do you wish the farmhouse had been burned down?... <i>Do you want to be rabid?</i>" She doesn't, of course, but in a certain way, that outcome makes sense. "'<i>God, if I am rabid, I am equal to what is outside</i>,' she said out loud, and felt an extraordinary relief as though, at last, she'd discovered what it was that could create a balance between the quiet, rather vacant progression of the days she spent in this house, and those portents that lit up the dark at the edge of her own existence." How fortunate and rare to discover such a perfect articulation of the human condition. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>Paula Fox has written many books for children and five other novels, as well as the memoir Borrowed Finery.

But books remain and retain another dignity, another presence...you don&#x2019;t see pictures the same way when you sink into a book as when you&#x2019;re strolling around an exhibition." - Anders Petersen</strong></p><p>Anders Petersen is one of Europe&#x2019;s most beloved documentary photographers. His black-and-white portraits, often of persons at the fringes of society-- prostitutes, transvestites, drunks and drug addicts--evince a rare compassion and warmth, and his images of lovers (one famous example of which adorns the cover of Tom Waits&#x2019; <i>Rain Dogs</i>) have come to constitute recurrent motifs throughout his oeuvre, expressing his "exaltation of humanity" (as a recent exhibition was titled). The 30 or so books Andersen has published over the course of his career have become an important part of the photo-book canon--most famously the 1978 book <i>Caf� Lehmitz</i>, which depicted Hamburg&#x2019;s seedy Reeperbahn in the late 1960s and 70s. In addition, Hasse Persson, former head of the Hasselblad Center and former director of the Bor�s Art Museum in Sweden, contributes a concise biography of Petersen&#x2019;s life and methodology. An essay by Urs Stahel--curator, art critic and director of the Fotomuseum Winthertur in Z�rich--further illuminates Petersen&#x2019;s photography from an international perspective.</p><p><b>Anders Petersen</b> was born 1944 in Stockholm, Sweden. In 1967 he began photographing the Caf� Lehmitz in Hamburg, where, in 1970, he held his first solo exhibition behind the bar, with 350 photographs nailed to the wall. In 1973 Petersen published his first photo book, <i>Gr�na Lund</i>, which depicted an amusement park in Stockholm. Swedish photographer Anders Petersen was elected Photographer of the Year at the Rencontres d&#x2019;Arles in 2003. In 2007, he was one of the four world finalists in the prestigious Deutsche B�rse Photography Prize.</p></p><p>Christian Caujolle studied in Paris with Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, and Pierre Bourdieu.

Like Shakespeare, he was of a prosperous middle-class family, but unlike Shakespeare he went to a university, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he received the bachelor&#x2019;s degree in 1584 and the master&#x2019;s degree in 1587. The terms of his scholarship implied that he was preparing for the clergy but he did not become a clergyman. Shortly before he received his M.A. the University seems to have wished to withhold it, apparently suspecting him of conversion to Roman Catholicism, but the Queen&#x2019;s Privy Council intervened on his behalf, stating that he &#x201c;had done her majesty good service&#x201d; and had been employed &#x201c;in matters touching the benefit of the country.&#x201d; His precise service is unknown. After Cambridge, Marlowe went to London, where he apparently lived a turbulent life (he had two brushes with the law and was said to be disreputable) while pursuing a career as a dramatist. He wrote seven plays--the dates of which are uncertain--before he was yet again in legal difficulties: he was arrested in 1593, accused of atheism. He was not imprisoned, and before his case could be decided he was dead, having been stabbed in a tavern while quarreling over the bill.</p><h2>Spot&#39;s Harvest</h2><p>Spot and his friends take a trip to the orchard in this fun new board book.

Whitfield: America and Other Writings by a Nineteenth-Century African American Poet</h2><p>In this comprehensive volume of the collected writings of James Monroe Whitfield (1822-71), Robert S. Levine and Ivy G. Wilson restore this African American poet, abolitionist, and intellectual to his rightful place in the arts and politics of the nineteenth-century United States. Whitfield&#39;s works, including poems from his celebrated America and Other Poems (1853), were printed in influential journals and newspapers, such as Frederick Douglass&#39;s The North Star. A champion of the black emigration movement during the 1850s, Whitfield was embraced by African Americans as a black nationalist bard when he moved from his longtime home in Buffalo, New York, to California in the early 1860s. However, by the beginning of the twentieth century, his reputation had faded. For this volume, Levine and Wilson gathered and annotated all of Whitfield&#39;s extant writings, both poetry and prose, and many pieces are reprinted here for the first time since their original publication. In their thorough introduction, the editors situate Whitfield in relation to key debates on black nationalism in African American culture, underscoring the importance of poetry and periodical culture to black writing during the period.</p><p>"Levine and Wilson have rescued the important but woefully understudied James M.

The lyrical age, according to Kundera, is youth, and this novel, above all, is an epic of adolescence; an ironic epic that tenderly erodes sacrosanct values: childhood, motherhood, revolution, and even poetry. Jaromil is in fact a poet. His mother made him a poet and accompanies him (figuratively) to his love bed and (literally) to his death bed. A ridiculous and touching character, horrifying and totally innocent (&#34;innocence with its bloody smile&#34;!), Jaromil is at the same time a true poet. He&#39;s no creep, he&#39;s Rimbaud.

Cats are getting kidney transplants. Could they one day be fellow citizens?<br><br>Cats and dogs were once wild animals. Today, they are family members and surrogate children. A little over a century ago, pets didn't warrant the meager legal status of property. Now, they have more rights and protections than any other animal in the country. Some say they're even on the verge of becoming legal persons.<br><br>How did we get here and what happens next?<br><br>In this fascinating exploration of the changing status of dogs and cats in society, pet lover and award-winning journalist David Grimm explores the rich and surprising history of our favorite companion animals. He treks the long and often torturous path from their wild origins to their dark days in the middle ages to their current standing as the most valued animals on Earth. As he travels across the country riding along with Los Angeles detectives as they investigate animal cruelty cases, touring the devastation of New Orleans in search of the orphaned pets of Hurricane Katrina, and coming face-to-face with wolves and feral cats Grimm reveals the changing social attitudes that have turned pets into family members, and the remarkable laws and court cases that have elevated them to quasi citizens.<br><br>The journey to citizenship isn't a smooth one, however. As Grimm finds, there's plenty of opposition to the rising status of cats and dogs. From scientists and farmers worried that our affection for pets could spill over to livestock and lab rats to philosophers who say the only way to save society is to wipe cats and dogs from the face of the earth, the battle lines are being drawn. We are entering a new age of pets one that is fundamentally transforming our relationship with these animals and reshaping the very fabric of society.<br><br>For pet lovers or anyone interested in how we decide who gets to be a person&#x201d; in today's world, Citizen Canine is a must read.

O. BLECHMAN'S</b> illustrations are instantly recognizable. For more than fifty years, his work has appeared on the covers of <i>The New Yorker</i>, run alongside op-eds in <i>The New York Times</i>, graced the pages of <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>, and, more recently, been featured on <i>The Huffington Post</i>, providing unspoken commentary on the world at large. In <i>Dear James</i>, Blechman has compiled all the wisdom he has accumulated over the course of his esteemed career into a series of poignant yet instructive letters written to an imagined young illustrator, "James." The result is a wise and mesmerizing meditation on creativity. <p> </p><p> Flush with wit and candor, Blechman's correspondence delves into his own trash can of false starts and failed beginnings, in addition to his artistic triumphs, to offer James both encouragement and criticism. He urges him to reach his potential as an artist, advising him on practical aspects -- proper technique, choice of work environments, dealing with editors -- and along the way provides invaluable insights on art, and life, that lay bare the challenges James will face as he aims to be successful in this demanding field. </p><p> </p><p> In the tradition of Rilke's <i>Letters to a Young Poet</i>, <i>Dear James</i> is an indispensable tool for any up-and-coming creative person looking for advice and inspiration, as well as a memorable read for those daring enough to chase their dreams. </p><p></p></p><p>January 20, 1984 <p> Dear James, </p><p> Before commenting on the drawings you were kind enough to send me (or foolish enough -- my tremulous line can sometimes cut and draw blood), I feel compelled to comment on your name. James. That speaks well for you. You've resisted the dreadful trend of reducing a perfectly good name to a sound bite. In going against the contemporary grain, in avoiding the crowd of Bobs and Bills, Tims and Toms, you have taken a different path than most people, and that is a good sign. All art worthy of its name has a counter look, has taken an errant path, one that others have not as yet taken -- a path that a James might tread. </p><p> You write that you would like to become a professional illustrator. Beware. Your work will ultimately not be judged by your peers. It's an editor, not an art director, who wields the almighty thumb in the savage arena of journalism. And editors are not noted for their visual taste. In the relationship of editors to art directors, the latter are invariably the junior partners. The very title, <i>illustrator</i>, implies the rank of the image. An image serves the text, it merely "illustrates" it. (A curious reversal of these roles occurred in the late 19th, early 20th centuries with the Parisian art dealer and publisher Ambroise Vollard. He often commissioned artists to provide visuals, then hired writers for the texts.) </p><p> A while back I wrote of the unequal relationship between writer and illustrator, and I can do no better than to repeat myself. If a text read, "'Bill kissed Sally in the hammock as it swayed gently between the hemlocks,' the illustrator's job was to strictly render Bill kissing Sally in the hammock as it swayed gently (not vigorously!) between the hemlocks (not pines!). It was not for illustration to aspire to the status of literature, as Anton Chekhov described it: 'The moon reflected in a piece of glass at the bottom of a stream.' Illustration was the moon, period. Or the glass, period. Nothing less, and nothing more -- no reflections, no distortions." </p><p> That has changed. In the mid-fifties, a revolution occurred and a new word entered the vocabulary of commercial art. <i>Concept</i>. Illustrators asked themselves, "What's the idea behind the text? How can we express an idea, and express it in a novel, and maybe even a startling way, that will expand, or comment upon the text?" In jazz parlance, a theme had become the occasion for a riff. Pranksters with our pens, we had become so many Charlie Parkers. </p><p> But the change was not entirely good. Our gain was also a loss. </p><p> The literal approach to text implied a literalness of technique and a high level of draftsmanship. There was great value in something well observed and carefully delineated. If the head and heart were often absent, there was something to be said for the presence of a hand. </p><p> Now, James, I have to pause and take a deep breath. It occurs to me that I've done everything except what you wanted me to do. Talk about your work. So I will answer your question. Finally. Let me say, as an overall comment, without going into details and very simply, that I like your work. I like its modesty. I like what's not said that doesn't need to be said. You get your ideas across with just enough to feed the eye as well as the mind. You draw a jacket and there are no buttons, no cuffs, no collar -- but there it is: a jacket that reads as a jacket, and satisfies as a drawing. Its simplicity shows respect for the viewer. You don't give more than what the mind needs, nor less than what the eye deserves. So bravo! Let's see more. </p><p> A final word. If you send your work to the magazines, you may be in for a shock. You may get a rejection note. The worst kind. A printed form. And probably you will be shattered. Shattered. We artists are hypersensitive, or we wouldn't be -- couldn't be -- artists. But don't, for God's sake, do what I once did -- try to find out if the signatures are real. They won't be. I used to get rejection slips from <i>The New Yorker</i>, but stubborn, or silly, me, I kept sending them stuff. Although once -- hallelujah! -- I did receive a letter, a real one with a genuine signature. At least it <i>looked</i> genuine. I wasn't sure. So I gave it what I call the spittle test. I licked my finger and ever-so-gently touched the edge of the signature. And it smudged! The <i>y</i> in <i>Geraghty</i> smudged! It was the real thing! The art director of <i>The New Yorker</i>, William Geraghty (or Geraght), had written twenty-three-year-old me to say that I should send him more work. Of course I didn't. Why tempt fate when I had taken such a notable step up the career ladder? </p><p> But you may not get letters signed by art directors. You probably will get printed rejection slips. And as I've said, you will be shattered. It may have been the third or fourth or thirteenth or fourteenth rejection slip that you've received, and you will think,<i> No, I'm not going to waste any more twenty-cent stamps</i> (twenty times <i>two!</i> There are all those self-addressed and stamped return envelopes), <i>so I will not send out any more drawings</i>. </p><p> So don't. You can send them to me. But not right away. I have a crazy deadline that will keep me busy for another few weeks. And then you can send me more of your drawings. It's not only your name I like. I like your work. </p><p> Best wishes, </p><p> R. O. Blechman </p><p> Copyright � 2009 by R. O. Blechman</p>"Under the guise of letters of advice to a young illustrator, R. O.

She performs her poetry with her band and lives in Honolulu, Hawaii. She is the author of The Woman Who Fell from the Sky and co-editor of Reinventing the Enemy&#39;s Language.Weaving together myth, generations-old stories and other souces of cultural memory, Harjo (The Woman Who Fell from the Sky; In Mad Love and War; etc.) explores the complexities of identity in a people still haunted by its violently disrupted past. (Harjo is a member of the Mvskoke or Creek Nation.) A facing-page dialogue between poetry and prose, the absorbing long poem "Returning from the Enemy," attempts to reconcile memories of the poet's absent father with memories of her own children, of ancestors and of "each trigger of grass": "We want to know if it's possible to separate and come back together, as the river licking the dock merges with the sea a few blocks away.// Long-legged birds negotiate the shore for food.// I am not as graceful as these souls." At its best, Harjo's map reveals regenerative human cycles that occur even in the midst of the most oppressive histories, with irreconcilably different worlds illuminating each other: a violent mugging becomes an encounter with the Navajo twin monsters; a fake snake set up to scare neighborhood birds becomes a fable of wisdom and perseverance. The more straightforward political critiques can be blandly accusatory: "Why have I come here/ I asked the dark, whose voice is the roar of history as it travels/ with the thoughts of humans who have made the monster." But Harjo's exploration of her layered selves reveals an identity of multiple influences, memories, obstacles and experiences.

He also learned how to lie in order to please his often volatile father, and put himself in harm's way to protect his mother and younger, weaker members of the family.<br><br> Much later in life, as Atz began to reflect on his upbringing, seek to understand his father, and heal his emotional scars, he discovered that the work of pioneering the frontier of the soul is an infinitely more difficult task than any of the back-breaking chores he performed on his family's homestead. Learning to use new tools -- honesty, vulnerability, forgiveness, acceptance -- and building upon the good helped him heal and learn to embrace the value of resilience. This revised perspective has enabled him to tell an enhanced and more positive version of the legacy his father created and has him doing the most rewarding work of his life: mapping his own inner wilderness while drawing closer to his adult children, the next stewards of the land he helped his father carve out of the Alaskan frontier.<br><br></p><p><b>Atz Kilcher</b> grew up the eldest son of Yule and Ruth Kilcher, who emigrated from Switzerland to Alaska in the late 1930s, joining some of Homer's earliest pioneer homesteaders. Today, Kilcher appears regularly alongside family members on Discovery Channel's popular show <i>Alaska: The Last Frontier</i>. He also performs music around the country, occasionally alongside his singer-songwriter daughter, Jewel; he also enjoys weaving baskets for art exhibits, and spending as much time as possible around a campfire with his grown children and lovely wife, Bonnie. <br><br>''As a son I cried tears of forgiveness, as a father, tears of regret and pain. And as a warrior of everyday life I cried tears of love, fear, and victory! A must-read.'' --Atz Lee Kilcher, son of Atz Kilcher and star of <i>Alaska: The Last Frontier</i><br><br> ''As a daughter, this book is transformative. Very seldom do we get windows into our parents private lives with such honesty. But I am most excited about this book for others to read, because it proves anyone can find forgiveness, love, and even change at any age. This is a tale of great courage and a ceaseless hope for a better life. My dad was the son of pioneers in the wild lands of Alaska, but miraculously he became a pioneer of a new kind of untamed wilderness: he became an Inner Pioneer. I guess trailblazing is a family tradition.'' --Jewel, singer and daughter of Atz Kilcher<br><br>''With incredible courage and honesty, Atz invites the world into the deepest recesses of his soul. Pain, fear, redemption, forgiveness -- it's all in there. The Alaskan wilderness is just the backdrop for the true final frontier -- the one in which a man faces himself and finds the means to overcome his hidden demons.'' --Bonnie Rose Ward, award-winning author of <i>Winds of Skilak: A Tale of True Grit, True Love, and Survival in the Alaskan Wilderness</i><br><br>''I've known Atz Kilcher and his family a long time, but never so well as I do after reading <i>Son of a Midnight Land</i>. Like the man -- it is personal, honest, charming, and often funny. It's the rare cowboy who can rope, yodel and write. Atz is one of those.'' --Tom Bodett, humorist, author, and panelist on NPR's <i>Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me!</i></p><h2>I Won&#39;t Go to Bed!</h2><p>When young Harry&#39;s frustrated father lets him stay up all night, Harry discovers that staying awake all night in a quiet, lonely house is not quite the treat he imagined it to be</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 2 In a common childhood fantasy, Harry defies his usual bedtime hour and attempts to stay awake through the night. His father reacts with nonchalancean almost chilling coldnessas he walks up the stairs to bed and never bothers to check on the child until he wakes up and goes downstairs early the next morning. In the quietness of the house settled for the evening, Harry uses the remote con trol to switch the televison off and on, he plays with his toys, scans the newspapers, and tries to have a party. Finally he falls asleep on the living room floor. His father finds him in the morning and helps Harry to his own bed. Harry is portrayed as a child out of place in the adult world of the late evening. Typical night sounds of owls hooting, clocks ticking, and even the qui etness are amplified. Baruffi's illustra tions are predominately from a child's floor level perspective. The furniture is oversized, towering above Harry. Dou ble-page spreads show expansive floor and wall backgrounds. This directs read ers' attention to the more colorful and de tailed items: Harry, his toys, and the party goods. Overall, these images are harsh. The book lacks the melodious and com forting tones of Brown's Goodnight Moon (Harper, 1947) or the family love and car ing exhibited in Polushkin's Mother, Mother, I Want Another (Crown, 1978). Mary Beth Burgoyne, Mesa Public Li brary, Ariz.<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Harry doesn't want to go to bed, so his father says, "Then don't," and goes to bed himself. Harry wanders around the house, playing with the remote control, singing songs to himself and listening to the sound of his father's breathing. He is startled by a mouse and a hooting owl and, after setting up dishes for a guestless party, eventually falls asleep on the floor, only to be retrieved by his dad in the wee hours. While Harry's father's insouciant attitude seems more callous than caring in the beginning, the tender ending compensates for his brusqueness. Baruffi's unusual perspectives and bold use of scale give the book a mood in keeping with its middle-of-the-night setting. Her use of color works well to sustain suspense through the night.

Moving from the historical and cultural overviews of the city in the first book, Kostof descends into the streets, sidewalks, squares, markets, and waterfronts of the city and presents a detailed urban anatomy. The book is organized thematically around the structural phenomena of the city-the city edge, street, public space, the marketplace, and the realities of cultural and ecomomic segregation-and explores the customs, practicalities, and biases behind the elements of the city. In every instance, Professor Kostof follows a far-ranging story up to the present to illustrate how fresh the discussion remains today. In the past, the various elements of a city evolved in response to a variety of pressures. Today, they are usually the result of planning decisions. In a final chapter, Kostof considers 'urban process' "the effect on cities of natural disasters, wars, and comprehensive redevelopment" compared with incremental growth and change. His book is thus an exercise in architectural and social history, a case study for the present, and a pointer for the future. <p>The story is also told in over three hundred drawings, prints, paintings, and photographs that illustrate not only typical elements of a city, such as a colonnaded street of ancient Palmyra, but also specific uses of particular elements, such as Prague's Wenceslas Square. The City Assembled is a fascinating account of the urban experience, writte, like The City Shaped, for general readers and professionals alike.</p></p><p><b>Spiro Kostof</b> (1936-1991) was Professor of Architectural History at the University of California at Berkley, and also taught at Yale, Columbia, MIT, and Rice universities.This final book by noted architectural historian Kostof, who died in 1991, is a companion to The City Shaped ( LJ 10/1/91; LJ's Best Books of 1991, LJ 1/92, p. 56). Here he considers the parts that make up the city through time--walls, urban divisions, public places, the street, and the urban process. The book is wide-ranging in time and space and presents the fruits of a lifetime of looking, but it is fragmented, appearing to be almost an assembly of notes for a more considered work or for The City Shaped. Still, the author is an astute observer, and his remarks are frequently illuminating for specialists and novices alike. This survey of the microparts of cities will be of interest primarily to professionals and historians but also to urban inhabitants, the same audience addressed by William Whyte ( City: Rediscovering Its Center , LJ 2/1/89).<br><i>- Jack Perry Brown, Art Inst. of Chicago Lib.</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Operations &#x2018;Leopard&#x2019; and &#x2018;Red Bean&#x2019; - Kolwezi 1978: French and Belgian intervention in Zaire (Africa@War)</h2><p>This book provides a history of the roots of FNLC (Front for the National Liberation of the Congo: ex-Katanga Gendarmerie) in Angola and Zaire, political situation under Mobutu regime, FNLC incursions into Zaire border since 1977 (&#x201c;Shaba Wars I and II&#x201d;) and subsequent hostage taking in mining town of Kolwezi.

They were standing in a quiet, sunlit room in Whitehall, the traffic outside inaudible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;A Spanish saint?&#x201d; he said, struggling to keep his voice more or less level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s not Spanish, she&#x2019;s English,&#x201d; Sir Walter replied patiently. &#x201c;She merely lives in Spain. Toledo, I&#x2019;m told. She is here to visit her family.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;And what is this to do with Special Branch, sir?&#x201d; Pitt asked. Special Branch had been created initially to deal with the Irish Problem, and now in the spring of 1898, its remit had broadened greatly to address anything that was considered to be a threat to the security of the nation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All Europe was in turmoil as the century drew toward its close. Unrest was escalating and becoming more open. Anarchist bombings occurred in one place or another every few weeks. In France the Dreyfus affair was raging on toward a climax no one could predict. There were even rumors that the government might fall.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Addressing the threat of assassination to a dignitary visiting England was among the duties of Special Branch&#x2014;but seeing to the needs of a touring nun, or whatever she was, was certainly not. Pitt opened his mouth to point this out, but Sir Walter spoke first.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;There have been letters containing threats against her life,&#x201d; Sir Walter said, his face completely expressionless. &#x201c;Her opinions have caused some concern and&nbsp;. . . anger. Unfortunately she has been rather too free in expressing them.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a police problem,&#x201d; Pitt said tersely. &#x201c;I doubt anyone here will care enough to argue with her, let alone cause a nuisance. But if they do, then the local police can take care of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sir Walter sighed, as if this was a tedious argument. &#x201c;Pitt, this is not a suggestion. You may think that many people are apathetic as to the exact details of religious doctrine, and only deeply committed Christians will argue with her&#x2014;and even if they do, you trust that they at least know how to behave within the law.&#x201d; He raised white eyebrows. &#x201c;If so, you are a fool. Some men will argue more passionately about religion than anything else on earth. To many, religion represents order, sanity, the inevitable victory of good over evil. It confirms to them their place in creation.&#x201d; He smiled bleakly. &#x201c;Somewhere near the top. The appearance of modesty forbids the very top. Something has to be held back for God.&#x201d; His smile faded and his eyes were grim. &#x201c;But say something to threaten that place near the top, and you threaten everything.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He shook his head. &#x201c;For God&#x2019;s sake, man, look at how religion has torn us apart throughout history. Start with the Crusades, and the Inquisition in Spain, the persecution of the Cathars and Waldenses in the rest of Europe, the massacres of the Huguenots in France. We&#x2019;ve burned both Catholics and Protestants ourselves. You think it couldn&#x2019;t happen again? If Dreyfus were not a Jew, do you think this whole monstrous affair would ever have started, never mind reached this proportion?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pitt drew breath to argue, and found the words frozen on his tongue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was barely the end of April. Earlier in the month President McKinley had asked the U.S. Congress for a declaration of war against Spain. Cuba had been seeking independence from Spain for many years, and the United States had begun to intervene in the dispute, seeing an opportunity to gain power and position. When the battleship USS <i>Maine</i> had been mysteriously blown up in Havana harbor, the powerful U.S. press openly blamed Spain. On 21 April Congress had ordered a naval blockade of all Cuban harbors, demanding that Spain surrender control of Cuba. On 25 April, four days ago, America had declared war. It was the first time they had done such a thing in their brief, idealistic existence. They had focused on internal expansion, had settled the land, built, explored and developed industry. Now suddenly the country was increasing the size of its armies and its navy and looking for possessions overseas, as far away as Hawaii and the Philippines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This new desire for outward expansion could grow to involve other naval powers, even Britain, if America chose to make it so. If anything went wrong with this Spanish woman&#x2019;s visit, it could easily be misconstrued by Spain. A chilling thought given the state of affairs across Europe. President Carnot of France had been assassinated four years ago. Last year it had been Prime Minister C�novas del Castillo in Spain, where the violence had reached new abominations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;She is bringing half a dozen or so of her&nbsp;. . . acolytes,&#x201d; Sir Walter went on, as if he had not noticed Pitt&#x2019;s absence of attention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;God only knows what sort of people they are, but we don&#x2019;t want any of them killed on our soil. I&#x2019;m sure you understand the embarrassment that would be to Her Majesty&#x2019;s Government. Especially in light of our history with Spain. We don&#x2019;t want to give them any excuses for war with us as well.&#x201d; He looked at Pitt carefully, as if possibly he had overestimated him and would be obliged to reconsider his opinion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; Pitt replied. &#x201c;Of course I understand. Is it even remotely likely that she would be attacked here?&#x201d; He asked the question not in a spirit of incredulity, but hoping for some assurance that it was not so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sir Walter&#x2019;s expression eased a little, the deep lines about his mouth less severe. &#x201c;Probably not,&#x201d; he replied with the ghost of a smile. &#x201c;But apparently this woman&#x2019;s English family do not approve of her at all. She left in the first place over some quarrel of principle, so I hear. Families can be the devil!&#x201d; There was some sympathy in his voice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pitt made a last effort to avoid the task. &#x201c;I would point out that domestic violence is also police work, sir, not Special Branch&#x2019;s. We have a big case of industrial sabotage at the moment that looks as if it is foreign inspired. It&#x2019;s getting worse and has to be stopped.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sir Walter&#x2019;s eyes were bright and sharp. &#x201c;I am well aware of Special Branch&#x2019;s concerns. I will remind you that it is the effect on the nation that determines whose problem it is, Pitt, and you know that as well as I do. If you didn&#x2019;t, believe me, you would not be long in your position.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pitt cleared his throat, and spoke quietly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Do we know the nature of this quarrel within the woman&#x2019;s family, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sir Walter gave a slight shrug. If he noticed the change in Pitt&#x2019;s tone, he was sophisticated enough not to show it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The usual sort of thing with willful daughters, I believe,&#x201d; he replied, the smile back on his face. &#x201c;She declined to marry the young man of excellent breeding and fortune, and tedious habits, whom they had selected for her.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pitt remembered that Sir Walter had three daughters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;And ran off to Spain and married some Spanish man of unknown character and probably unknown ancestry, at least to Sofia&#x2019;s parents,&#x201d; Sir Walter added. &#x201c;I imagine it was embarrassing to them.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;How long ago was this?&#x201d; Pitt asked, keeping his face as expressionless as he could. His own daughter, Jemima, was fast approaching marriageable age. He didn&#x2019;t like to think about it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, it has been some time,&#x201d; Sir Walter replied ruefully. &#x201c;I think it is her religious views that have now compounded the problem. It wouldn&#x2019;t matter so much if she kept them to herself. But she has formed something of a sect. Has her acolytes, as I mentioned.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Roman Catholic?&#x201d; Pitt imagined a cult to do with the Virgin Mary, perhaps, causing old persecutions to be remembered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Apparently not.&#x201d; Sir Walter lifted one elegant shoulder. &#x201c;It hardly matters. Just see that no one attacks her while she is in England. The sooner she leaves the better, but alive and well, if you please.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pitt straightened to attention. &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Sofia Delacruz?&#x201d; Charlotte said with a sudden sharpening of interest. She and Pitt were sitting by a low fire in the parlor, the curtains drawn across the French windows onto the garden. Almost all the light was gone from the cool spring sky and there was a definite chill in the air. Sixteen-year-old Jemima and thirteen-year-old Daniel were both upstairs in their rooms. Jemima would be daydreaming, or writing letters to her friends. Daniel would be deep in the adventures of the latest <i>Boy&#x2019;s Own Paper.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pitt leaned forward and put another log on the fire. It gave less heat than coal, but he liked the smell of the apple wood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Have you heard of her?&#x201d; he asked with surprise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Charlotte smiled slightly self-consciously. &#x201c;Yes, a bit.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He remembered Sir Walter&#x2019;s reference to a scandal in the past; he knew how Charlotte loathed gossip, even when it was the lifeblood of investigation. She listened to it, but with guilt, and a thread of fear. She had seen too many of its victims firsthand to take pleasure in it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What did you hear?&#x201d; he said gravely. &#x201c;She may be in danger. I need to know.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Charlotte did not argue, which in itself was indicative of a different kind of interest. He detected concern in her eyes. She put down the sewing she had been doing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You are going to protect her?&#x201d; she asked curiously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve assigned Brundage to it,&#x201d; he replied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Not Stoker?&#x201d; She was puzzled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Stoker&#x2019;s quite senior now,&#x201d; he pointed out. He did not want to be sharp and set a division between them. This quiet evening alone with her was the best part of his day. Its peace mattered intensely to him. &#x201c;He has other responsibilities. Brundage is a good man.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard Sofia&#x2019;s ideas are pretty radical.&#x201d; She was gazing at him steadily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;For example?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; she admitted, pushing the sewing away entirely and leaning forward a little. &#x201c;Perhaps I&#x2019;ll go and listen to what she has to say when she arrives. She has to have more fire than our local minister.&#x201d; Charlotte went to church on most Sundays because she took the children. It was a natural part of belonging to the community and of being accepted. It was also the best place for Jemima and Daniel to meet other youths whose families Charlotte knew in a somewhat substantial way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>More often than not, Pitt discovered some pressing duty elsewhere on Sundays.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pitt nodded agreement, but he was far more conscious of a sharp memory stirring in his mind. His mother had taken him to the parish church on the edge of the estate every Sunday of his childhood. He could still picture the shafts of colored light slanting downward from the stained-glass windows; smell the stone and faint odor of dust. There were shuffles of movement, a creaking of stays, and the dry riffle of pages being turned. Very seldom had he actually listened to the sermons. Some of the stories from the Old Testament were good, but they were isolated, forming no consistent history of God and man. To him the Bible seemed to be more a series of errors and corrections, well-earned disasters and then heroic rescues. A lot of the rest of it was lists of names, or wonderfully poetic prophecies of desolation to come.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Had he believed any of it? And even if he had, did it matter? If he were honest, the stories from his borrowed copies of <i>The Boy&#x2019;s Own Paper</i> had stirred his heart far more, with their tales of adventure, of heroes any boy would want to copy. He smiled now with quiet pleasure; he felt a sense of identity with his son when he saw Daniel reading. The magazine now had a new name, the stories had different settings, but the spirit was the same.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So what was it that still clung to him so sharply about those old memories of church? The companionship of his mother, the rare sense of peace within her when she was there, as if she were at last safe, loved and completely unafraid? He had thought at the time that her faith was simple and certain. While he was glad for her, because he knew it comforted some of her fears that he could not, he had no desire to be the same way. It was a subject they had never spoken about, out of choice on both of their parts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He wondered now if perhaps it had not been nearly as easy for her to keep faith as he had supposed, that she had led him to think it was because it took a certain burden from him. It was one area in which he could be a child. She had allowed him that, as she had so many other things of which he had been unaware at the time. She had died without ever telling him she was ill. She had sent him away so he would not notice, not suffer with her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Charlotte was watching him, waiting. Was she aware of the thoughts inside him?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You truly want to go and listen to her?&#x201d; Pitt said, breaking the silence at last.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said immediately. &#x201c;As I said, I&#x2019;ve heard she is outrageous, even blasphemous in her ideas. I&#x2019;d love to know what they are.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He realized how little he and Charlotte had ever spoken of their beliefs when it came to matters of religion. And yet he knew everything else about her. He knew what hurt her, made her angry, and made her laugh or cry, who she liked and what she thought of them, and what she thought of herself. Often he would read her emotions by her expression. At other times it was in far smaller things: a sudden silence, an unexplained kindness, the letting slip an old grudge someone else could have held on to, and through these small actions he knew she had understood a shadow, or a pain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Does it matter to you?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;If she is blasphemous.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She looked at him with surprise. At first he thought it was because he had asked. Then he realized that she was surprised to not have a ready answer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I have no idea,&#x201d; she confessed. &#x201c;Perhaps that is why I want to go. I&#x2019;m not sure I even know what blasphemy is. Cursing, or the desecration of a shrine, I understand. But what is an idea that is blasphemous?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Darwin&#x2019;s <i>On the Origin of Species,</i>&#x201d; he answered immediately. &#x201c;The suggestion that we evolved from something lesser rather than descended from something greater. It threatens our entire concept of ourselves.&#x201d; He smiled ruefully.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, if that is what she has come to talk about, she is a little late to cause trouble with it,&#x201d; Charlotte said drily. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been fighting about that one already for the last thirty some years! It isn&#x2019;t even interesting anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re not coming, then?&#x201d; He tried to keep his face straight, as if he were not deliberately teasing her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m coming!&#x201d; she said instantly, then realized what he was doing and smiled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen a woman blasphemer. Do you suppose there will be a riot?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He did not satisfy her by answering.</p>...</p><h2>Jerusalem&#39;s Queen (Silent Years)</h2><p>When her father and sister are killed, a distant relative invites Salome and her mother to live with his family in Jerusalem.

He has a moon crater named after him and a star on Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of Fame. He has been showered with accolades and honored with prizes galore, everything from an Emmy Award to the National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. He has inspired generations of readers to dream, think, invent, believe, and fly. When Ray Bradbury speaks, it pays dividends in gold to everyone who listens.</p><p>Collected between these covers are memories, ruminations, opinions, prophecies, and philosophies from one of the most influential and admired writers of our time: indelible boyhood experiences that molded the man, as well as his eye-opening, sometimes hilarious true adventures in the realm of the famous and adored; insightful, piquant, often biting, always fascinating reflections on humankind's past and future, and where we stand in the universe today; provocative and deeply affecting musings on the present state of art and the unparalleled glory of creation.</p><p>As unique, unabashed, and irrepressible as the artist himself, here is an intimate portrait, painted with the master's own words, of the one and only Bradbury -- far more revealing than any mere memoir, for it opens windows not only into his life and work, but into his mind and heart as well.</p><p>Ray Bradbury has something wonderful to say.</p></p><p><p>In a career spanning more than seventy years, Ray Bradbury, who died on June 5, 2011 at the age of 91, inspired generations of readers to dream, think, and create. A prolific author of hundreds of short stories and close to fifty books, as well as numerous poems, essays, operas, plays, teleplays, and screenplays, Bradbury was one of the most celebrated writers of our time. His groundbreaking works include <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, <em>The Martian Chronicles</em>, <em>The Illustrated Man</em>, <em>Dandelion Wine</em>, and <em>Something Wicked This Way Comes</em>. He wrote the screen play for John Huston's classic film adaptation of <em>Moby Dick</em>, and was nominated for an Academy Award. He adapted sixty-five of his stories for television's <em>The Ray Bradbury Theater</em>, and won an Emmy for his teleplay of <em>The Halloween Tree</em>. He was the recipient of the 2000 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, the 2004 National Medal of Arts, and the 2007 Pulitzer Prize Special Citation, among many honors.</p><p>Throughout his life, Bradbury liked to recount the story of meeting a carnival magician, Mr. Electrico, in 1932. At the end of his performance Electrico reached out to the twelve-year-old Bradbury, touched the boy with his sword, and commanded, "Live forever!" Bradbury later said, "I decided that was the greatest idea I had ever heard. I started writing every day. I never stopped."</p>The grand master's many fans will delight in behind-the-scenes stories about the creation of such science fiction classics as <i>The Martian Chronicles </i>and <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes </i>(which began as a film project for Gene Kelly), but that's just one of Bradbury's many facets on display in this collection of 37 essays. We also learn about his encounters with famous men, from Walt Disney to Bertrand Russell; adventures in Hollywood; and even his love for going out in the rain. Some of these stories may be familiar, and some are told twice, but Bradbury's friendly, conversational tone always makes them worth hearing again. (The tale of how he overcame his fear of flying especially benefits from the jocular narration.) Some of the essays haven't been seen in decades, like an introduction to a paperback edition of Verne's <i>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</i>, which cleverly juxtaposes captains Nemo and Ahab, and a dozen are being published for the first time. Whether Bradbury is talking about cross-country train trips or manned flight to Mars, his enthusiasm remains as contagious as ever. The intimate connection many readers already feel through Bradbury's fiction will be strengthened by these highly personal reminiscences. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

During this period preaching continued to support the historic Christian faith while the church undertook to resist secularization, come to grips with biblical criticism, and initiate bold overseas missions.<br><br> Opening with the revived Catholic Order of Preachers, continental Protestants such as Abraham Kuyper, and the self-consciously modern preaching of Friedrich Schleiermacher, Old moves on to consider Victorian figures such as John Henry Newman and Charles Haddon Spurgeon. He carefully lays out the tensions between Old and New School Calvinism as well as the beginnings of black preaching and the great American tradition of Charles Finney, Dwight L. Moody, Harry Emerson Fosdick, and many more. In the twentieth century Old's focus falls on the crises of the two world wars, especially the courageous ministries of German, Dutch, and Hungarian preachers during the Third Reich.</p><p>Hughes Oliphant Old is John H. Leith Professor of Reformed Theology and Dean of the Institute for Reformed Worship at Erskine Theological Seminary, Columbia, South Carolina.</p><h2>Drawing Surrealism</h2><p>Drawing, often considered a minor art, was central to Surrealism from the very beginning. Automatic drawing, exquisite cadavers, and frottage are just a few of the techniques invented by Surrealists as means to tap into the subconscious realm. While previous books have examined the connection between drawings and Surrealist paintings, Drawing Surrealism is the first to recognize the medium as a fundamental form of Surrealist expression, and to explore its impact on other media as well. Surrealist collage, photography, and even paintings are presented in the context of drawing as a metaphor for innovation and experimentation. It is also the first book to encompass a wide array of artists on a global scale&#x2015;from the great figures in Surrealist history to lesser-known Surrealists from Japan, Central Europe, and the Americas, where the movement had a profound and lasting effect. In addition to brilliant reproductions of drawings and other works by more than 100 artists, this volume also includes a substantial historical essay by the exhibition&#x2019;s curator as well as informative essays by leading scholars. This groundbreaking book offers a deep understanding of the techniques and concerns that made Surrealism such an intimate perceptual revolution.</p><p>Leslie Jones is Curator of Prints and Drawings at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.&#x201c;[T]his book illustrates the conceptual force of Surrealism in a way that, arguably, has not been so clear&#x2015;or fun&#x2015;before.

Within the book are over 150 razor-sharp photographic reproductions, mostly of church windows. Brisac's text is scholarly and extensive, raising it above the stained glass picture book. A few caveats: the density of the text is in some ways frustrating, with the plates not always well-integrated with the text, and a dearth of illustrations for some windows described as key examples. Further, as the emphasis is on European glass, there is little regarding contemporary U.S. artisans, who have been important in revitalizing the craft. Nevertheless, well worth considering for academic and large public libraries.

Toby Peters returns to the scene to investigate the case, a crime in which Hollywood superstar Clark Gable might be the prime suspect.</p><p>Stuart M. Kaminsky is professor of film history and director of the Florida State University Conservatory of Motion Picture, Television, and Recording Arts.Appearing for the 19th time, down-and-out Hollywood detective Toby Peters teams up with Clark Gable in this fast-paced and colorful addition to a very successful series. In 1943, after the movie star receives a poem linking him to a series of deaths (some projected), he hires the detective, whose name was written on the same sheet of paper as the poem, to investigate. Toby is unable to prevent the next killing. Further messages lead to more deaths, with all the victims having one thing in common-they had been extras in Gone with the Wind five years previously during the burning of Atlanta scene when another extra had been killed with a sword. The death had been covered up by the studio. Aided by his usual crew-midget Gunther Wherthman, landlord Jeremy Butler and dentist Sheldon Minck-Toby aims to beat the killer to other potential victims. At the same time, he tries to protect the extremely depressed Gable, who hasn't recovered from the death of his wife, Carole Lombard, the previous year and who resists Toby's attempts to stash him in a safe place. Kaminsky's masterful tale is funny, warm and powerfully moving. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Further Adventures of Rush Revere: Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims / Rush Revere and the First Patriots / Rush Revere and the American Revolution / Rush Revere and the Star-Spangled Banner</h2><p>Explore the earliest days of the United States with this boxed set of the #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling Time Travels with Exceptional Americans series from Rush Limbaugh!<br><br>Millions of young readers have taken a ride with Rush Revere and his trusty steed, Liberty.

Murphy needs fifteen thousand dollars by the end of the day, or the city of Los Angeles can say goodbye to the El Healtho clinic. A recovery center for the most severe cases of alcoholism in the state--even if no one ever does quite seem to get dry there--El Healtho has been the bane of Dr. Murphy&#39;s existence ever since he started running it. But now that its doors are about to close forever, Dr. Murphy finds he&#39;ll do anything to keep it open. Up to and including admitting Humphrey Van Twyne III, a patient with an extremely violent past whose wealthy family has the means to keep El Healtho open for business. Sure, the man isn&#39;t exactly an alcoholic. And yes, what he really needs is to be under the care of the surgeons who performed the lobotomy that&#39;s rendered Van Twyne all but a vegetable. But the money&#39;s good--until the rag-tag group of ne&#39;er-do-wells at El Healtho begin to wreak havoc with Dr. Murphy&#39;s plans, and suddenly no one day has ever seemed so long. A literary precursor to One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest, THE ALCOHOLICS is Thompson like you&#39;ve never read him before, a pitch-black, mad-cap portrait of deviant behavior that is at once darkly comic, humane and harrowing. 127 pages.</p><p>Murphy runs a clinic to cure alcoholics. But his charges believe that the only thing that will fix them is another drink. To this bitter struggle of wills, add an orderly who doubles as a quack practitioner, a nurse who is both alluring and ingeniously sadistic, and a misplaced patient whose main problem is his lack of a frontal lobe, and the result is one of Jim Thompson&#39;s most harrowingly funny yet deeply sympathetic novels.(1906 - 1977) James Meyers Thompson was born in Anadarko, Oklahoma. He began writing fiction at a very young age, selling his first story to <i>True Detective</i> when he was only fourteen. Thompson eventually wrote twenty-nine novels, all but three of which were published as paperback originals. Thompson also wrote two screenplays (for the Stanley Kubrick films &#x201c;The Killing&#x201d; and &#x201c;Paths of Glory&#x201d;). An outstanding crime writer, the world of his fiction is rife with violence and corruption. In examining the underbelly of human experience and American society in particular, Thompson&#x2019;s work at its best is both philosophical and experimental. Several of his novels have been filmed by American and French directors, resulting in classic noir including <b>The Killer Inside Me</b> (1952), <b>After Dark My Sweet</b> (1955), and <b>The Grifters</b> (1963).</p><h2>Worship and Theology in England, Volume I: From Cranmer to Hooker</h2><p><p>The description for this book, Worship and Theology in England, Volume I: From Cranmer to Hooker, will be forthcoming.</p></p><p></p><h2>Singing Flame: A Memoir of the Civil War, 1922-24</h2><p>Page edges are tanned and light fading to spine, overall a good clean copy.</p><p></p><h2>The Penguin Book of Curious and Interesting Mathematics</h2><p>David Wells&#39;s intriguing anthology spans the centuries as he introduces a collection of choice eccentrics: people who looked for logical loopholes in the American Constitution, calmed their nerves with algebra or used sextants to measure the buttocks of Hottentot women.

Despite Furhman's long-held belief that the president was the victim of a plot, his examination of the forensic evidence&#x2014;the recovered bullet fragments, the autopsy reports and the legendary Zapruder film&#x2014;leads him to adopt the lone gunman theory (although he thinks that previous proponents of that position erred in believing one of Lee Harvey Oswald's shots missed its mark). This clunky, lightweight effort is unlikely to change many minds and does not begin to approach the careful, reasoned analysis of Gerald Posner's <i>Case Closed</i>, which also defended the first official inquiry's lone gunman theory of the murder. Nor does Fuhrman fully address the many questions raised by serious conspiracy scholars such as Anthony Summers or Robert Blakey; for example, he completely ignores arguments that Jack Ruby's connections with organized crime bear further study. Whatever the truth of the matter, readers will not be convinced by his case for the thesis that this was a "simple murder."

With a cheeky raven for a companion, Trupp rambles through the city, going virtually unnoticed by humans--that is, until they are confronted by a homeless woman who sees Trupp for who he really is. Before Trupp can decide whether to stay or run away, this unusual woman realizes that he could use a little help. &#x201c;Fans of <i>Stellaluna, </i>Cannon&#x2019;s exceptional debut book, will approach her second with high expectations--and those will be met.&#x201d;--<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br></p><p>Janell Cannon's picture books have won many awards and are beloved around the world. She is the author and illustrator of<i> Verdi, Crickwing, Pinduli,</i> and the long-time bestselling classic <i>Stellaluna</i>. Born and raised in Minnesota, Ms. Cannon now lives in Southern California.Fans of Stellaluna, Cannon's exceptional debut book, will approach her second with high expectations-and those will be met. Carefully crafted prose and stunning art shape a story that delicately spans the fictional and real, at the same time delivering a message worthy of reflection. Curious about what lies beyond his Family Cave, Trupp, a cat-like creature with snow-white fur and ice-blue eyes, walks for days until he approaches "people-dwellings." The peace-loving Fuzzhead borrows clothing from a scarecrow so humans won't notice his odd appearance and, accompanied by a raven, heads for a city. No one on the bustling streets pays any attention to Trupp until he meets a homeless woman named Bernice, who removes a piece of broken glass from his foot and takes him to a safer part of town. Equally affecting as her text, Cannon's poignantly detailed acrylic and pencil art underscores the contrasts between Trupp's primitive homeland and the gritty, graffiti-scarred city; and between his ethereal presence and the eccentric, gaudy appearance of Bernice, who keeps half a dozen toothbrushes tucked into her woolen cap. As the new friends settle down to sleep in the park, Bernice's wise words expose the heart of the story: "Funny, isn't it? I wear all this bright stuff to keep from feeling invisible. When people stare at me, it helps me know I'm here. But Trupp puts on clothes so he will disappear." Cannon says so much so simply.

But when a related story broke the record for hits at the Chicago Tribune's website, it was clear that such unexplained objects continued to occupy the minds of fascinated readers. Why, wonders Thomas Bullard, don't such persistent sightings command more urgent attention from scientists, scholars, and mainstream journalists?<br><br>The answer, in part, lies in Bullard's wide-ranging magisterial survey of the mysterious, frustrating, and ever-evolving phenomenon that refuses to go away and our collective efforts to understand it. In his trailblazing book, Bullard views those efforts through the lens of mythmaking, discovering what UFO accounts tell us about ourselves, our beliefs, and the possibility of visitors from beyond. <br><br>Bullard shows how ongoing grassroots interest in UFOs stems both from actual personal experiences and from a cultural mythology that defines such encounters as somehow "alien"&#x2014;and how it views relentless official denial as a part of conspiracy to hide the truth. He also describes how UFOs have catalyzed the evolution of a new but highly fractured belief system that borrows heavily from the human past and mythic themes and which UFO witnesses and researchers use to make sense of such phenomena and our place in the cosmos.<br><br>Bullard's book takes in the whole spectrum of speculations on alien visitations and abductions, magically advanced technologies, governmental conspiracies, varieties of religious salvation, apocalyptic fears, and other paranormal experiences. Along the way, Bullard investigates how UFOs have inspired books, movies, and television series; blurred the boundaries between science, science fiction, and religion; and crowded the Internet with websites and discussion groups. From the patches of this crazy quilt, he posits evidence that a genuine phenomenon seems to exist outside the myth.<br><br>Enormously erudite and endlessly engaging, Bullard's study is a sky watcher's guide to the studies, stories, and debates that this elusive subject has inspired. It shows that, despite all the competing interests and errors clouding the subject, there is substance beneath the clutter, a genuinely mysterious phenomenon that deserves attention as more than a myth.</p><p>"A wide-ranging and wonderfully informed look at an elusive and difficult subject. Bullard, a folklorist, does a remarkable job of analyzing the UFO-and-abduction phenomenon's similarities with ancient myths and legends."--David M. Jacobs, editor of <i>UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge</i><p> "A compelling and admirable study that combines lucidity and intellectual rigor. Bullard outlines in eloquent prose the difference between the stimulus (puzzling sightings and encounters) and the stimulated (witnesses, investigators, theorists, hoaxers, skeptics, and spiritual seekers) to reveal a complex and shifting phenomenon that continues to challenge our understanding of reality."--Jerome Clark, author of <i>The UFO Encyclopedia</i></p>Thomas E.

But they were not alone. Centuries earlier, the Cherokees came from the north, conquered the local tribes, and settled there.</p> <br> <p>In the year before the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, British Indian agents began inciting the Cherokees, Shawnees, and other western tribes. The frontiersmen mobilized their militias and eventually defeated the Cherokees. Afterward, James Robertson was appointed an Indian agent to keep the peace.</p> <br> <p>In 1779, Robertson entered into an agreement with Richard Henderson and John Donelson to settle the area around the French Lick, which would later become Nashville. After their arrival in 1780, Indian attacks soon commenced. Using large-scale attacks and small ambushes, the protracted war against the settlers lasted for fifteen years. Richard Henderson fled, and John Donelson was killed. James Robertson's determination and steadfast leadership was the glue that kept the infant settlement together.</p> <br> <p>George Washington appreciated Robertson's leadership and appointed him brigadier general of the Western Militia. Andrew Jackson's military training began as a private serving in General Robertson's militia. Jackson learned well and years later replaced Robertson after his retirement. Boone, Clarke, Sevier, Shelby, Blount, and Bledsoe were other leaders who trusted James Robertson.</p> <br> <p>James Robertson's long military and civic career began before the American Revolution and ended after the Battle of Talladega during the War of 1812. He was a brave, intelligent and patriotic leader who believed in Manifest Destiny and founded Nashville, the nation's westernmost settlement of that era.</p></p><p>" <p>Bill Bays earned his bachelor&#x2019;s degree from Claremont McKenna College and a master&#x2019;s degree from California State University, Fresno.

Hall, the hero of <b>Game Wars</b>, is the Dirty Harry of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service whose goal in life is to stop poachers dead in their tracks and who doesn't mind blowing away a few bad guys to do it. (Mind you, we're not talking about the backwoods denizen who bags a deer off-season now and again, but an organized underground economy that may soon drive the alligator extinct for its skin, the walrus extinct for its ivory.) Marc Reisner's account of Hall's dangerous exploits is as thrilling, and infinitely more satisfying on those rare occasions when the hero wins, than any movie chase scene.Poaching is a term usually associated with illicit hunting and trade of wild animals in Third World countries. In this page-turner of a book, Reisner, author of Cadillac Desert ( LJ 8/86), introduces readers to the lucrative American black market in wildlife contraband and to the undercover Fish and Wildlife Service agents who are battling poachers. He dogs the heels of special agent Dave Hall into the Louisiana swamps where Hall infiltrates an alligator smuggling ring. He also describes Hall's attempt to bring down the Alaskan ivory trade and reveals the magnitude of fish poaching in the South. Reisner concludes with a history of the abuse of American wildlife resources that makes one wonder how it could have been allowed to happen. This lively, fast-paced tale of corruption, greed, and poaching at home is highly recommended for public library collections.<br><i>- Edell Marie Peters, Brookfield P.L., Wis.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Thornton Wilder:The Bridge of San Luis Rey and Other Novels 1926-1948 (Library of America No. 194)</h2><p>Thornton Wilder was the rare writer whose achievements as a playwright were matched by equal abilities as a novelist. As companion to its volume of Wilder's collected plays, The Library of America's edition of his early novels and stories brings together five novels that highlight his wit, erudition, innovative formal structures, and philosophical wisdom. <br><br>Drawing on the post-collegiate year he spent in Rome, Wilder fashioned in <i>The Cabala</i> a tale of youthful enchantment with the Eternal City in the form of a fictitious memoir of an American student and the enigmatic coterie of noble Romans who draw him into their midst. He followed this debut novel two years later with <i>The Bridge of San Luis Rey</i>, which catapulted him to literary prominence and earned him the first of his three Pulitzer prizes.&nbsp;Set in 18th-century Peru, the book is a kind of theological detective story concerning a friar's investigations into the lives of five individuals before they were killed in a bridge collapse. An elegantly told parable, with credible historical ambience and psychologically rounded characters, <i>The Bridge of San Luis Rey</i> is primarily a probing inquiry into the nature of destiny: Why did God allow these particular people to die? <br><br><i>The Woman of Andros</i>, based on the <i>Andria</i> of Roman writer Terence, is a meditation on the ancient world filtered through the sensibility of a meditative courtesan; <i>Heaven's My Destination</i>, a departure from Wilder's historical themes, is a picaresque romp through Depression-era America; and <i>The Ides of March</i> takes up the story of Julius Caesar's assassination by imagining the exchange of letters among such prominent ancient figures as Catullus, Cleopatra, Cicero, and Caesar himself, "groping in the open seas of his unlimited power for the first principles which should guide him." The volume concludes with a selection of early short stories--among them "Pr�cautions Inutiles," published here for the first time--and a selection of essays that offers Wilder's insights into the works of Stein and Joyce, as well as a lecture on letter writers that bears on both <i>The Bridge of San Luis Rey</i> and <i>The Ides of March</i>.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

They must have &#34;faith in His name, character and atonement . . . faith in His Father and in the plan of salvation.&#34; That statement keynotes this book&#39;s powerful message on the first principle of the gospel. In his creative, invigorating style, Elder Neal A. Maxwell here brings to our attention many crucial applications of this fundamental doctrine. He points to the believer&#39;s joy in the sheer reality of Jesus Christ, the divine Savior; the intense suffering involved in His amazing atonement; and the consequent uniqueness and power embodied in His holy name- the only name whereby salvation can be obtained. Faith in His impeccable character is similarly urged as we note in detail the celestial attributes we seek to emulate as well as his being &#34;tempted as we are, yet without sin&#34;- truly the Great Exemplar. This outstanding, stimulating book brings fresh and intriguing insights to the important subjects it discusses.

Grant uses a full range of tones and tempos to create distinct voices for all the characters in this story of Billy's encounter with the Ladderless Window-Cleaning Company. Grant's Pelly speaks with a speech impediment and a singsong rhythm; his monkey is slightly breathless, but, sadly, his giraffe does not sound female as the text clearly indicates. Grant shines when various characters sing; his portrayal of the opera star turned duchess singing about her stolen diamonds is a particular delight.

Still our nation&#x2019;s longest running &#x201c;cold case,&#x201d; the mystery of Elma Sands finally comes to a close with this book, which delivers the first substantial break in the case in over 200 years. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the closing days of 1799, the United States was still a young republic.&nbsp; Waging a fierce battle for its uncertain future were two political parties: the well-moneyed Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, and the populist Republicans, led by Aaron Burr. The two finest lawyers in New York, Burr and Hamilton were bitter rivals both in and out of the courtroom, and as the next election approached&#x2014;with Manhattan likely to be the swing district on which the presidency would hinge&#x2014;their &nbsp;animosity reached a crescendo. Central to their dispute was the Manhattan water supply, which Burr saw not just as an opportunity to help a city devastated by epidemics but as a chance to heal his battered finances.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But everything changed when Elma Sands, a beautiful young Quaker woman, was found dead in Burr's newly constructed Manhattan Well. The horrific crime quickly gripped the nation, and before long accusations settled on one of Elma&#x2019;s suitors, handsome young carpenter Levi Weeks. As the enraged city demanded a noose be draped around the accused murderer&#x2019;s neck, the only question seemed to be whether Levi would make it to trial or be lynched first.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young man&#x2019;s only hope was to hire a legal dream team.&nbsp; And thus it was that New York&#x2019;s most bitter political rivals and greatest attorneys did the unthinkable&#x2014;they teamed up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At once an absorbing legal thriller and an expertly crafted portrait of the United States in the time of the Founding Fathers, <i>Duel with the Devil</i> is a masterpiece of narrative nonfiction.</p></p><p><p><b>A Few Things You Didn't Know About Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr, and America's Oldest Cold Case</b></p> <ul> <li>Manhattan's municipal water system had just debuted when the body of Elma Sands was found in one of its wells in 1800. Now in modern-day SoHo, back then the area was part of "Lispenard's Meadow"&#x2014;and Greenwich Village really was still a village.</li> <li>Aaron Burr created NYC's water service as cover for a banking scheme that would turn the 1800 election against Alexander Hamilton. Their rivalry had high stakes: Manhattan was the swing district of the presidential election's swing state.</li> <li>Not only did the plan work, Burr's bank ploy took on a life of its own; his Manhattan Company eventually became Chase Manhattan.</li> <li>Hamilton and Burr were also the city's top lawyers, but served together on just one murder case: in defending carpenter Levi Weeks for the murder of Elma Sands. The trial attracted thousands of spectators, and was the nation's first fully recorded murder case.</li> <li>Hamilton's <em>first</em> outing as a criminal defense lawyer was less auspicious. He defended a client charged with dueling&#x2014;and lost.</li> <li>Defendants in capital cases were rarely allowed to speak in their own behalf; they were considered hopelessly biased. They had good reason to be: conviction for murder earned a sentence of hanging <em>and</em> dissection.</li> <li>The murder trial of Levi Weeks was the longest NYC had ever known; its jury had to be put up for the night in City Hall. Afterwards, both Hamilton and Burr claimed to be the one who figured out the real murderer.</li> <li>Now in the basement of the Il Pozzo restaurant at 129 Spring Street, the infamous Manhattan Well is one of the oldest surviving unsolved crime scenes in the city.</li> </ul>PAUL COLLINS is the author of eight books.

And when he was caught, they gave him more.<br><br>There are no folk heroes more all-American than con artists. Though we may openly condemn them, deep down we admire their brazen bravado, their cleverness, their shrewd understanding of how to rouse ambition and greed in their hapless victims. They offer the American dream on the quick, and, after all, don&#x2019;t suckers get what they deserve?<br><br>Oscar Hartzell was born in 1876, on the Illinois prairie. Rising from humble origins, he worked hard as a farmer and then as a rancher on the grand scale in Iowa and Texas. But his flair for business didn&#x2019;t match his ambition, and his dream of success foundered. A bankrupt, he was in his late thirties when in 1915 he met a couple who promised to turn his mother&#x2019;s six thousand dollars into six million by delivering to her a share of the long-lost fortune of Sir Francis Drake. Hartzell joined their operation, apparently believing in it, before realizing it was a fraud and then boldly stealing it from under their noses and turning it into an enterprise that netted him millions. <br><br>Hartzell moved to London, out of the reach of frustrated American lawmen, restyling himself as an English aristocrat. While living a life of hedonistic grandeur, he played the hayseed for the folks back home, selling as many as a hundred thousand Midwesterners on a get-rich-quick scheme that seemed every bit as reasonable as the wildly speculative investments being touted on Wall Street. The year 1929 came, the stock market crashed &#x2014; and then his life began to get very strange. His victims turned him into a messiah.<br><br>The extraordinary story of Oscar Hartzell has been all but forgotten and never told in full until now. Richard Rayner employs a wealth of original research and previously unseen documents to re-create a saga that stands out both for the sheer longevity and outrageousness of Hartzell&#x2019;s con and for what its amazing twists and turns tell us about the tens of thousands of solid American citizens who, crushed by the Depression, believed to death in the most outrageous of frauds.</p><p>&#x201c;This is a completely delicious account of an episode that must be accorded classic status in the history of that great American art: the confidence game.

Delightfully entertaining and playfully inventive, his "paintings with scissors" are also a superb introduction to the most basic artistic concepts: color, line, and form. <p>This engaging and accessible look at Matisse&#x2019;s cut-outs, arguably the highlight of his magnificent career, follows the artist as he goes in search of pure forms of expression. Illustrated with beautiful reproductions and details of Matisse&#x2019;s most famous works, the book explains how the artist&#x2019;s paintings evolved over the course of his life, gradually becoming flatter, simpler and more chromatically pure until they resembled the cut outs themselves. Matisse&#x2019;s spontaneity, his love of bold colors, and his seemingly effortless ability to capture movement on paper make him one of the most appealing artists to children. Fun and easy-to-follow, this exploration of Matisse&#x2019;s cut-outs invites children of all ages to grab a pair of scissors, find some colored paper, and "paint."</p></p><p>Max Hollein has worked at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, and is currently director of the Schirn Gallery in Frankfurt, Germany.

Heinlein was sixty-six, at the height of his literary career; J. Neil Schulman was twenty and hadn't yet started his first novel. Because he was looking for a way to meet his idol, Schulman wangled an assignment from the New York Daily News--at the time the largest circulation newspaper in the U.S.--to interview Heinlein for its Sunday Book Supplement. The resulting taped interview lasted three-and-a-half hours. This turned out to be the longest interview Heinlein ever granted, and the only one in which he talked freely and extensively about his personal philosophy and ideology. <p>"The Robert Heinlein Interview" contains Heinlein you won't find anywhere else--even in Heinlein's own "Expanded Universe." If you wnat to know what Heinlein had to say about UFO's, life after death, epistemology, or libertarianism, this interview is the only source available. </p><p>Also included in this collection are articles, reviews, and letters that J. Neil Schulman wrote about Heinlein, including the original article written for The Daily News, about which the Heinleins wrote Schulman that it was, "The best article--in style, content, and accuracy--of the many, many written about him over the years." </p><p>This book is must-reading for any serious student of Heinlein, or any reader seeking to know him better.</p></p><p>Our Dutch Uncle <p>Foreword by Brad Linaweaver </p><p>"He is in our heads." So writes J. Neil Schulman about his hero, Robert A. Heinlein. My friend of thirty years, Bill Ritch, has used the same phrase as long as I&#x2019;ve known him. But just who is the "our?" Do Neil and Bill mean the community of science fiction professionals? Do they mean the fans? I think not. </p><p>The "our" refers to an area where two special interests meet: science fiction and libertarianism. For science fiction enthusiasts who are not libertarians (the majority), Heinlein is an important figure in the field and an influence on many writers. For libertarians who are not science fiction readers (the majority), Heinlein is an interesting footnote in the literature of liberty. But for those of us who combine these two passions and have optimism in the future, Robert Anson Heinlein is God. </p><p>We have needed this book for a very long time. As Mrs. Heinlein says in her endorsement, this interview will appeal both to readers of science fiction and to libertarians. But for those of us who burn for technological marvels and want freedom to enjoy them instead of being slaves to a technocratic Big Brother, Heinlein created the blueprint that may get us to a better world. Not Utopia, because he taught us that </p><p>The Robert A. Heinlein Interview and Other Heinleiniana such a dream truly is nowhere. A better world, on the other hand, is not impossible. It is simply hard to achieve. </p><p>When he died, the larger world paid attention to his impact on us; yes, on those of us who take The Moon is a Harsh Mistress seriously! As I wrote in New Libertarian, the Associated Press mentioned his libertarianism. </p><p>The science fiction press did its best to ignore the same thing. I was annoyed at the time. Now I see that the SF world was trying to do him a favor by ignoring his politics. They gave him a vacation from their usual slanders and libels. </p><p>Now with the Hollywood blockbuster of Starship Troopers, the SF community is back to normal; back to calling Heinlein a fascist. And what of his defenders? They know full well that the limited government model of liberty is every bit as objectionable to today&#x2019;s totalitarians as is any anarchy. Those who call Heinlein a fascist know that they are lying. Those who deny Heinlein&#x2019;s libertarianism from the other direction know they are lying, too. </p><p>In this, the best interview with Heinlein, Neil Schulman inspired the following comment from his hero: "I would say that my position is not too far from that of Ayn Rand; that I would like to see government reduced to no more than internal police and courts, external armed forces &#x2014; with the other matters handled otherwise. I&#x2019;m sick of the way the government sticks its nose into everything, now." Also: "The justification for free enterprise is that it&#x2019;s free." </p><p>There is only one kind of mentality in this sorry world that describes such expressions of American individualism as fascist: the Marxist mind. That this discredited mode of thought dominates science fiction criticism is no surprise. It still holds sway in New York and Hollywood. It may be finished in Moscow but it&#x2019;s doing fine at Harvard and Yale. </p><p>That is why we need this book. Robert A. Heinlein is our Dutch Uncle. Maybe the American family is falling apart for lack of decent father figures but at least we still have the voice of one sane man who tells us to be the best we can be and expects even more than an Army recruitment ad. (Besides, he&#x2019;s Navy!) </p><p>The United States of America beat its greatest enemies of the century. Heinlein was there in the fight against fascism (and its virulent mutant form of Nazism) as well as in the 75-year-long struggle against Soviet Communism. We defeated these monsters and now our reward seems to be domestic tyranny at the hands of our worst elements, true parasites of the soul. </p><p>Naturally such people cannot stand the work of Robert A. Heinlein. Naturally they accuse the man of propagating what is actually their own evils. </p><p>The trouble for them is that Heinlein won&#x2019;t go away. They can&#x2019;t let him go away.

In 1914, he arrived in New York with letters of introduction to managers of several large hotels. Having worked his way up to a position as a waiter at the Ritz-Carlton, he left to enlist in the United States Army in 1917. Eventually he opened his own restaurant; only in 1934 did he turn to writing, at the suggestion of a friend in publishing who, noticing the whimsical paintings with which he covered the walls of his apartment, urged him to undertake a children&#39;s book. Hansi, the first of Bemelmans&#39; fifteen books for children, beguiled most reviewers with its simple watercolor illustrations and nostalgic story of two children and their dog in the Austrian Tyrol. His greatest success, however, was Madeline, a rhymed picture book about a Parisian schoolgirl who becomes the envy of her classmates when her appendix is removed. Indeed, the Madeline books, of which there were five, remain the work that Bemelmans is primarily remembered for. The inspired amateurishness of the illustrations and the sophisticated doggerel verses have been an influence on later juvenile literature. Madeline&#39;s Rescue, the second book in the series, was awarded the Caldecott Medal in 1953. Bemelmans claimed to have no imagination, and all his books were the more or less direct product of his experience. He described his life as a restaurateur in Life Class and Hotel Splendide, his travels to Ecuador and Italy in The Donkey Inside and Italian Holiday, and his stint as a Hollywood screenwriter in the novel Dirty Eddie. At the time of his death he was working on the story of his childhood. Bemelmans was a genial satirist and lover of life, but a serious intent often underlay his humor, especially in his novels. A case in point is Blue Danube, a fanciful story set on an island of the Danube, the comedy of which is very much clouded by the appearance of a band of odious Nazis. A somewhat more successful novel was Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep, concerning the unusual journey of an elderly Ecuadorian general from his villa in Biarritz to his home in South America. From the time of his marriage to Madeline Freund in 1935 (they had one daughter, Barbara) until his death in New York of pancreatic cancer, Bemelmans traveled, painted, and generally wrote a book or two a year. Reviewing his posthumous novel, the comic love story The Street Where the Heart Lies, Burling Lowrey in Saturday Review called Bemelmans &#34;a superb craftsman with a sure eye for atmospheric detail and a supremely accurate ear for the speech of Adult Innocents madly in love with the unattainable.. . He was a complete original, with an absolutely unique temperament and view toward the world.&#34;</p><h2>Finally (Willow Falls)</h2><p>A humorous look at what it means to FINALLY turn twelve years old.<br><br>You can pierce your ears when you're twelve.

But what is the mind? What do we mean when we say we are aware&#x201d; of something? What is this peculiar state in our heads, at once utterly familiar and bewilderingly mysterious, that we call awareness or consciousness?<br><br>In <i>Physics in Mind</i>, eminent biophysicist Werner R. Loewenstein argues that to answer these questions, we must first understand the physical mechanisms that underlie the workings of the mind. And so begins an exhilarating journey along the sensory data stream of the brain, which shows how our most complex organ processes the vast amounts of information coming in through our senses to create a coherent, meaningful picture of the world. Bringing information theory to bear on recent advances in the neurosciences, Loewenstein reveals a web of immense computational power inside the brain. He introduces the revolutionary idea that quantum mechanics could be fundamental to how our minds almost instantaneously deal with staggering amounts of information, as in the case of the information streaming through our eyes.<br><br>Combining cutting-edge research in neuroscience and physics, Loewenstein presents an ambitious hypothesis about the parallel processing of sensory information that is the heart, hub, and pivot of the cognitive brain. Wide-ranging and brimming with insight, <i>Physics in Mind</i> breaks new ground in our understanding of how the mind works.<br></p><p><b>Werner R. Loewenstein</b> was professor of physiology and biophysics at Columbia University and director of its Cell Physics Laboratory. Author of <i>The Touchstone of Life</i>, he lives in Woods Hole, on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.<br><b><i>Physics World</i></b><br> This book is a fantastic journey for any reader, but especially for a physicist. In Loewenstein's account, life is a delicate dance between the bits of information and quantized chunks of energy that drive all biological processes. Accordingly, he takes us on an intellectual rollercoaster ride.... Loewenstein is an engaging writer, one who spices his prose with elaborate wordplay, assonance, internal rhymes, puns, metaphors and quotations. All those verbal high jinks go to good use, put into the noble service of communicating hard stuff in a comprehensible fashion.... This is a ripping good read. Each chapter brings novel insights into the fundamental workings of life. Those who buy their ticket and take the ride will emerge breathless, but enlightened.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Metapsychology Online Reviews</i></b><br> <i>Physics in Mind</i> makes a bold...argument. It offers a unification of physics and biology on a higher, more sophisticated level than one usually finds. It even offers a plausible glimpse of that storied grail: brain as quantum computer.... [A] significant contribution to outlining the bigger picture.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Physics World</i>'s 2013 Book of the Year</b><br> In the hands of a less scrupulous author, a book such as <i>Physics in Mind</i> could easily have strayed into the world of quantum woo', in which the weird effects of quantum mechanics are conveniently trotted out as the explanation for every problem, with scant regard to evidence. But Loewenstein, despite his enthusiasm for applying physics principles to biological topics, is careful to avoid such traps.... Loewenstein's prose is both distinctive and enticing, and his beautifully clear explanations of more traditional' physics topics such as quantum computing and the cosmological arrow of time are among the best we have seen.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Jane Smiley, <i>Harper's</i></b><br> [An] absorbing account . [Loewenstein's] book is vital and wide-ranging, exploring everything from the structure of time to the phenomenon of gut feelings, the color of white and the reach of our senses, and why we've adapted to notice the anomaly rather than the norm.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Booklist</i>, starred review</b><br> Defying the usual disciplinary boundaries, Loewenstein deploys a Darwinian physics (replacing the daunting mathematics with clear bioneurological narrative, laced with sprightly humor) to explain how the cosmic volley of information arrows loosed by the Big Bang set the course for evolution.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Seth Lloyd, Professor of Quantum-Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and author of <i>Programming the Universe</i></b><br> Werner Loewenstein's <i>Physics in Mind</i> is a passionate exploration of how biological systems process information. Starting from how molecules transform information and energy at the most microscopic level, where quantum mechanics plays a central role, Loewenstein provides clear and elegant explanations of the mechanisms of sight and smell, of senses and neural signals, culminating with the phenomenon of consciousness itself. Erudite, witty, and highly accessible, <i>Physics in Mind</i> proves once and for all that the unquantized life is not worth living.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Trends in Cognitive Science</i></b><br> Loewenstein takes readers on a delightful journey through one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time: the quest to understand how physics can explain brain function and consciousness. With precise, engaging, and often provocative prose, Loewenstein dares to delve into fundamental questions at the intersection of physics, biology, neuroscience, and philosophy. Every page explodes with enthusiasm, metaphors, and food for thought. It is not common to find science books that are accurate, without oversimplifications, and yet read like pieces of fiction that cannot be put down.... [A] masterpiece of scientific outreach and discourse. This must-read book will promote vigorous scientific discussion in many circles.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Psychology Today</i></b><br> To perceive and understand the world around us, we need to process vast amounts of information. While the brain dedicates dense networks of neurons to the task, biophysicist Loewenstein explains that the heavy lifting is done by a complex array of microscopic particles making calculations at the quantum level.... Ultimately, survival depends on how well an organism can spot patterns and distinguish signal from noise a test of computational power. It's an indication, Loewenstein notes, that to understand the mysteries of consciousness, we may have to think small.&#x201d;</p><h2>Dogs: Their Fossil Relatives and Evolutionary History</h2><p>Xiaoming Wang and Richard H. Tedford have spent the past 20 years studying the evolutionary history of the family Canidae. Both are well known for having established the modern framework for the evolutionary relationship of canids. Combining their research with Mauricio Ant�n's impeccable reconstructions of both extinct and extant species, Wang and Tedford present a remarkably detailed and nuanced portrait of the origin and evolution of canids over the past 40 million years. <br><br>The authors cull their history from the most recent scientific research conducted on the vast collections of the American Museum of Natural History and other leading institutions. The fossil record of the Canidae, particularly those from their birth place in North America, are the strongest of their kind among known groups of carnivorans. Such a wonderfully detailed evolutionary history provides access to a natural history that is not possible with many other groups of carnivorans.<br><br>With their rich fossil record, diverse adaptations to various environments, and different predatory specializations, canids are an ideal model organism for the mapping of predator behavior and morphological specializations. They also offer an excellent contrast to felids, which remain entrenched in extreme predatory specializations. The innovative illustrated approach in this book is the perfect accompaniment to an extremely important branch of animal and fossil study. It transforms the science of paleontology into a thrilling visual experience and provides an unprecedented reference for anyone fascinated by dogs.</p><p>Xiaoming Wang and Richard H.

White smoke, the color of mourning, billowed low over the water.Sultan Mahmut II was dead. He had come to the throne of Osman as the turbaned ruler of a medieval empire, and had died in a frock coat and a fez. In his long reign he had given the Ottoman Empire French saddles, a constitution of sorts, modern drill and percussion rifles. He had destroyed the ferocious Janissaries, as an obstacle to progress, and he had lost Greece to the Greeks and Crimea to the Russians and Egypt to an Albanian adventurer called Mehmet Ali Pasha. He had built himself a modern palace, at Besiktas, where he maintained a harem like sultans of old.The harem was in pandemonium.&#x201c;You are the Kislar aga, Ibou. You must help them to leave,&#x201d; Yashim said quietly. &#x201c;The sultan&#x2019;s harem is your domain. The sultan has died, and the women must move on.&#x201d;The Kislar aga, the master of the girls, shut his eyes and pressed his fingers against his smooth cheeks. &#x201c;They&#x2014;they do not want to go, Yashim.&#x201d;&#x201c;Abd�lmecid is sultan now. Any moment he may arrive here, at Besiktas, and he will bring his women.&#x201d; Yashim gestured to the staircase.The Kislar aga took a deep breath and started up the stairs. &#x201c;You must come with me. We must get the women away.&#x201d;Yashim followed reluctantly as the Kislar aga bustled through the gallery, clapping his hands. &#x201c;The carriages are come, ladies! To the carriages!&#x201d;Not one of the women paid him the slightest attention. They had spent years learning how to behave, how to speak, how to be beautiful, devoting their lives to the service of the sultan. Now the sultan was dead and carriages were to take them away.They wanted to wail and scream, and to mourn.To mourn the sultan, their youth, their hopes.And grab what they could, while there was still time.Copyright � 2011 by Jason Goodwin</p><h2>A Soul in Place: Reclaiming Home As Sacred Space</h2><p>Pages clean and unmarked.

His novels include Flicker and The Memoirs of Elizabeth Frankenstein, which is currently being made into a motion picture. Roszak lives in Berkeley and is professor of history at California State University, Hayward. A Guggenheim Fellowship recipient, he has twice been nominated for the National Book Award.Repeatedly, in this scholarly survey of cultural history, Roszak (History/California State Univ.; Flicker, 1991, etc.) evokes a back-to-nature philosophy, contrasting the rational philosophy of the Enlightenment with the romanticism of the noble savage; prehistoric animism and earth-mother religion with the rise of patriarchy and male-dominated, nature-dominating religion. All this by way of elaborating what he sees as the only salvation of the ecological crisis: a new ``ecopsychology.'' The new school celebrates the individual, seen in harmonious interrelationships with the family, society, Mother Earth, and, ultimately, the cosmos. Ecopsychology is informed by various post- Freudian schools: some Jung (collective unconscious), and something of Reich, Maslow, Gestalt psychology, and various California-style movements--in general, those schools that look upon the unconscious as the well-spring of creativity. ``The core of the mind is the ecological unconscious,'' Roszak says, containing ``the living record of cosmic evolution, tracing back to distant initial conditions in the history of time.'' Yes, time's arrow and the evolution of the cosmos figure large in Roszak's philosophy. Taking the Big Bang as a given, and borrowing arguments from systems theory, the Gaia hypothesis, and the anthropic principle, he sees the emergence of humanity as inevitable in the grand scheme of things. It follows, then, that we must get back on track with Mother Earth. How to do this finds Roszak lamenting urban- industrial society. Cities are bad. Deep ecology is good. The restorative work must begin in childhood, and must involve a breaking away from macho ideas and the invoking of some concepts of ecofeminism. Roszak turns a fine sentence and knows his history (if not his science), but his idealism pays no mind to the population problem, poverty, disease, or rising racial-ethnic conflicts; and it dismisses the cultural largesse of cities and pays scant homage to what science and technology might do. In short, there seems to be more wish than reality here. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The McGann's passionate and insightful writing evokes the raucous cast of riders, promoters, and journalists thrusting through highs and lows worthy of opera. This volume stands out as a must-read book for anyone seeking to appreciate cycling's race of races." <br> <i>-Peter Joffre Nye, author of <b>The Six-Day Bicycle Races: America's Jazz Age Sport and Hearts of Lions</b></i> <br><br> "There are LOTS of books on the Tour de France. An increasing number of them are actually written in English. However, of those, none educates Americans about this grand spectacle&#x2019;s rich past. The Tour de France has a history as fascinating and sordid as Rome&#x2019;s and it is high time someone undertook to explain this to our American sensibility. Our guide for the trip is a man with a ravenous appetite for both world history and bicycle racing, just the sort of person to paint a Tour champion with the dramatic grandiosity befitting Hannibal himself." <br> <i>-Pat Brady, Editor, <b>Asphalt Magazine</b></i> <br><br> At the dawn of the 20th Century, French newspapers used bicycle races as promotions to build readership. Until 1903 these were one-day events. Looking to deliver a coup de grace in a vicious circulation war, Henri Desgrange&#x2014;editor of the Parisian sports magazine L&#x2019;Auto&#x2014;took the suggestion of one of his writers to organize a race that would last several days longer than anything else, like the 6-day races on the track, but on the road. <br><br> That&#x2019;s exactly what happened. For almost 3 weeks the riders in the first Tour de France rode over dirt roads and cobblestones in a grand circumnavigation of France. The race was an electrifying success. Held annually (suspended only during the 2 World Wars), the Tour grew longer and more complex with an ever-changing set of rules, as Desgrange kept tinkering with the Tour, looking for the perfect formula for his race. <br><br> Each year a new cast of riders would assemble to contest what has now become the greatest sporting event in the world.</p><p>Bill and Carol McGann have had their lives inextricably tied up with bicycles about as long as they can remember.

Jackson was arguably the greatest commander of the Civil War. Yet "Stonewall" Jackson owed much of his success to the troops who served under him. He eagerly gave them their due: "You cannot praise these men of my brigade too much; they have fought, marched, and endured more than I even thought they would." The Stonewall Brigade, composed mainly of Virginians from the Shenandoah Valley, proved its mettle at First Manassas and never let up--even after its esteemed leader was shot down at Chancellorsville. Their equally elite counterparts in the Army of the Potomac were known as the Iron Brigade, hardy westerners drawn from Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan. By focusing on these two groups, historian Jeffry Wert retells the story of the Civil War's eastern theater as it was experienced by these ordinary men from North and South.<p> His battle descriptions are riveting, especially when he covers Antietam: </p><blockquote>Three times the Georgians charged towards the guns, and three times they were repelled. Union infantry west of the battery ripped apart the attacker's flank, and the artillerists unleashed more canister.... Finally, the Georgians could withstand the punishment no longer, and as more Union infantry piled into the Cornfield, Hood's wrecked division retreated towards West Woods and Dunker Church. When asked later where his command was, Hood replied, "Dead on the field."</blockquote> But the book is perhaps most notable for the way in which it describes the everyday hardships befalling each side. They often lacked food, shoes, blankets, and other military necessities. When the war began, the men believed deeply in their conflicting causes. Before it was over, writes Wert, "the war itself became their common enemy." Wert is slowly but surely gaining a reputation as one of the finest popular historians writing about the Civil War; <i>A Brotherhood of Valor</i> will undoubtedly advance his claim. <i>--John J. Miller</i>Jeffry D. Wert is the author of&nbsp;eight previous books on Civil War topics, most recently <i>Cavalryman of the Lost Cause </i>and&nbsp;<i>The Sword of Lincoln</i>. His articles and essays on the Civil War have appeared in many publications, including<i> Civil War Times Illustrated</i>, <i>American History Illustrated</i>, and <i>Blue and Gray</i>. A former history teacher at Penns Valley High School, he lives in Centre Hall, Pennsylvania, slightly more than one hour from the battlefield at Gettysburg.</p><h2>Devil&#39;s Kin</h2><p><b>Action-packed western adventure from the author of <i>Crow Creek Crossing</i>.<br> <br> THE WRONGED SIDE OF THE LAW</b><br> <br> Jordan Gray was hot on the trail of some killers when his wife and child needed him most.

He was a Fellow and Tutor in English Literature at Oxford University until 1954, when he was unanimously elected to the Chair of Medieval and Renaissance Literature at Cambridge University, a position he held until his retirement. He wrote more than thirty books, allowing him to reach a vast audience, and his works continue to attract thousands of new readers every year. His most distinguished and popular accomplishments include <em>Out of the Silent Planet</em>, <em>The Great Divorce</em>, <em>The Screwtape Letters</em>, and the universally acknowledged classics The Chronicles of Narnia. To date, the Narnia books have sold over 100 million copies and have been transformed into three major motion pictures.</p><p>Clive Staples Lewis (1898-1963) fue uno de los intelectuales m�s importantes del siglo veinte y podr�a decirse que fue el escritor cristiano m�s influyente de su tiempo.

In 1968 she was awarded the prestigious Kate Greenaway Medal for her outstanding contribution to children's literature.Grade 3 Up-This who's who presents 33 mostly nonhuman characters or groups that appear in Lewis's classic series. They are briefly described and some of their stories related. The words are largely Lewis's own, though plucked selectively, and omitting much, from the originals. The selection is skillfully done, but transitions between description and storytelling are sometimes awkward. The full-color paintings retain the liveliness and expression of the originals, but their scale and perspective make them grander all around. Whereas the original pen-and-ink drawings were often seen from a distance and punctuated the text only occasionally, these bordered and decorative landscapes and closeups present constant and considerably fleshed-out vistas and creatures. Though the new art is impressive, and often lovely, readers may miss the smaller-scale charm and sharply etched detail of the black-and-white originals. Those who've read the books will find the most to enjoy here, seeing old friends and enemies in fuller garb. The sheer numbers will confuse Narnia neophytes, and despite the attempt to provide context in the descriptions, some knowledge of characters is assumed. Lewis's outline of Narnian history appears, as does a succinct annotation of each title. Brian Sibley's Land of Narnia (HarperCollins, 1990) also includes a few new paintings by Baynes (different from these), but, with its biographical and literary angles, adds new information. The art is the draw in the Book of Narnians, and it is fascinating to see the artist take on things these many years later, but the originals are still quite wonderful enough.<br><i>Nancy Palmer, The Little School, Bellevue, WA</i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Report for Murder: A Lindsay Gordon Mystery (Lindsay Gordon Mystery Series)</h2><p><p>Lindsay Gordon, Scottish journalist and amateur sleuth, was the first creation of international bestseller Val McDermid. <i>Report for Murder</i> introduced the United Kingdom&#x2019;s first lesbian detective, and the series has been perennially popular ever since.

She was a journalist for sixteen years, spending the last three as Northern Bureau Chief of a national Sunday tabloid. Now a full-time writer, she divides her time between Manchester and Northumberland.The first US publication of a novel that appeared in 1987 in England. Here, gay journalist Lindsay Gordon (Deadline for Murder, 1997, etc.), based in Glasgow and presently freelancing to eke out a living, makes her debut when longtime friend Paddy Callaghan, a drama teacher at the Derbyshire House Girls' School, gets her a magazine assignment for a story on the school's fund-raising weekendan event that's part of the schools battle to fend off builder James Cartwright, who wants to buy its athletic fields for residential development. Other weekend guests include novelist/talk-show star Cordelia Brown and famed cellist Lorna Smith-Coupey. As the audience awaits a benefit concert that evening, Lorna is discovered dead-garrotted by a cello stringin one of the backstage music rooms. In short order, a truculent Inspector Dart has jailed Paddy for the killing, and school head Pamela Overton has authorized Lindsay and Cordelia (lovers at first sight) to try to find evidence to clear Paddy. A string of tedious interviews, plus repetitive reviews of time frames and alibis, produces a host of Lorna-hating suspects, but it's a second death that pushes our journalist-sleuth to a violent confrontation with the not-so-surprising killer. Clumsy plotting, relentlessly verbose characters, and a sluggish pace don't help Lindsay's overextended debut outingone of the author's lesser efforts. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

As in Aesop's Fables, Sakya Pandita uses proverbs and stories to address the basic question: "How are we to live peaceably with ourselves and with others?"<br> <br>This is the only available English translation of the Sakya Legshe--a book that reveals the heart of the Buddhist way of life.</p><p>Sakya Pandita Kunga Gyaltsen (1182-1251) was a renowned scholar and Tibetan statesman who staved off a Mongolian invasion by converting Emperor Godan Khan to Buddhism. A luminary of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, his peerless erudition stands out even among a tradition known for its scholastic adepts, and many of his works have been bedrock texts for study and practice since the thirteenth century.<br><br>John Davenport is a water resources development specialist with wide experience as an aid consultant in South and East Asia and Tibet, including for the Tibetan government-in-exile.

He is a member of the Khon family, who have been important teachers of Buddhism in Tibet since the eighth century.

Sakya Pandita's masterpiece gives advice on the conduct of life suitable for the ordinary individual. Because many of the similes and metaphors used by the 13th century author are difficult to understand, John Davenport has used modern commentaries to clarify and explain the verses. Davenport opens timeless Tibetan wisdom to Western readers." -- Gelek Rinpoche, Jewel Heart<br><br>"If you want to know, not how lamas learned their Buddhism, but how Tibetan peasants learned it, this is your book." -- Huston Smith, author of The World's Religions<br><br>"The English translation of Sakya Pandita's <i>The Treasury of Good Advice</i> is indeed welcome as it presents the ancient wisdom in ordinary life. By composing the verses in a clear and coherent fashion, the great author reinforced the then ongoing trend to refine the native culture and inspire the common people. It thus became one of the most popular classics throughout Tibet and its cultural sphere. In my childhood, I memorized its verses, and they brought me solace during difficult times. John Davenport translated both the verses and the commentary with accuracy and clarity, giving us a far better rendering than the previous one." -- L.P.

Flanking the key German city of Aachen, the forest was one of the formidable natural barriers interspersed with German fortifications in the West Wall in September 1944.</p><p>Charles Whiting served with a reconnaisance outfit in WWII and has since become one of the premier historians of the war. Among his many best-selling works are <i>Patton, The Last Assault,</i> and <i>Death on a Distant Frontier.</i> He currently lives in York, England.From September 1944 to February '45, in the longest battle ever fought by the U.S. Army, division after division were sent into the Hurtgen Forest on the Belgian-German border. By the time the smoke cleared, nearly 30,000 GIs had been killed or wounded. Whiting makes it painfully clear that the battle of Hurtgen was unnecessary and had more to do with the maintenance of high-level reputations than strategic imperatives. He argues that Hurtgen was the forerunner of an attitude that became pervasive in Vietnam, where "generals were still throwing away the lives of their young soliders with the same careless abandon." Whiting ( Bloody Aachen ) describes the battle with a sure hand; there is plenty of heroism on these pages, but little glory. As he points out, the only soldier of Hurtgen remembered today is "the one who ran away": Pvt. Eddie Slovik, the first American soldier executed for desertion since the Civil War.

It begins with a general exposition of mechanical principles: dynamic, static, and straining forces. It then covers successive experiments at bicycle and tricycle design, including several "mechanical monstrosities."<br> <br> With the aid of elegant, sometimes humorous drawings, the book examines various designs for their relative stability, steering advantages, gearing and resistance properties. The final selection discusses the design of individual components in detail, including the frame (from the point of view of stress analysis); wheels; bearings; chains and chain gearing; toothed-wheel gearing; the lever-and-crank gear; tires; pedals, cranks and bottom brackets; springs and saddles; and brakes.<br> <br> A definitive work in its own time, <i>Bicycles and Tricycles</i> is a collector's item for history-lovers as well as bicycle-enthusiasts&#x2014;a treat for tinkerers and all those interested in the history of invention.</p><p></p><h2>DK Handbook: Wildflowers of the Mediterranean (DK Handbook)</h2><p>The visual recognition guides in this series are designed to make identification as simple and accurate as possible.

These stallions of impressive bloodlines-Thoroughbreds, Arabians, Morgans, and Lippizaners-were bred carefully, developing a cadre of military-worthy horses for the United States and its allies around the world. This book shows how these horses positively contributed to the outcome of conflicts and wars waged the world over and how the war horses also had strong civilian demand and dramatically influenced equestrian bloodlines across our country.</p><p>Phil Livingston is a lifelong horseman and equestrian journalist, and the longtime horse editor of Western Livestock Journal and editor of Paint Horse Journal. Ed Roberts is a lifelong horseman and cattleman and has been executive secretary of the American Paint Horse Association for twenty-six years.As the director of an history museum I am often asked to review books and such was the case of War Horse. I was amazed at the scholarship that went into this wonderful book. Its told as a story of the U S Army Remount service which supplied a standard mount for the Cavalry but much more it tells the story of the development of a "using" kind of horse. One of the best parts of the book are the wonderful side bar stories and photos about everyone from George Patton to Francis the talking mule! The complete data on almost every aspect of breading the war horse will make this book a valuable reference. If you like horses or if you just want to know how one of our country's first mass produced war machines was developed this needs to be in your hands.

After a disastrous six-month stint in the drug squad, he became addicted to heroin and resigned in disgrace. Now twenty-four, sickly, and on the dole, Alex learns that his high school love, Victoria Patawasti, has been murdered in America. Victoria?s wealthy family sends Alex to Colorado to investigate the case, and he seizes the opportunity for a chance at redemption. But things don?t go exactly as planned. Struggling to kick his heroin habit, forced to go on the run after the only credible witness to Victoria?s murder is accidentally killed, wanted by both the Colorado cops and the Ulster police who believe he has information about a corruption scandal, and with the murderer closing all the time, Alex will have a fight on his hands just to stay alive, never mind solving the case.</p><p>Adrian McKinty was born and grew up in Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles. He studied politics at Oxford University and after a failed legal career he moved to the US in the early 1990s. He found work as a security guard, postman, construction worker, barman, rugby coach and bookstore clerk before becoming a school teacher in Denver, where he now lives.<b><i>Chapter 1: Creator, Sustainer, Destroyer</i></b><br><br>Seven time zones west of Belfast the murdered girl was alive yet and well. She was confident, popular, young and clever -- this last virtue was going to be the death of her.<br><br>That and a slug from a .22.<br><br>She lay snug in the groove of the futon mattress. Over her: a cotton sheet and a fleece blanket. The fan on for noise. The humidifier for moisture. The heat in the middle of the thermostat. She was comfortable, as comfortable as one could be in this bed, in this room, in this building, in this town.<br><br>I know all this because I read the police report.<br><br>Perhaps the humidifier cast off a little light that illuminated her face. An interesting face. Imperious, marked, beautiful. Of good background, of good stock. Actually -- and although she said it was unimportant -- of good caste. She had dark eyes and dark hair. An aristocrat, you might have said, or someone who could play the archetypal rich girl who disdains and then ultimately falls for the poor but handsome boy in the silliest of Hindi films.<br><br>Victoria Patawasti was clever but even the cleverest can't be experts at all things. The encryption software for her computer diary had said that the FBI's Cray supercomputers would take years of processing time to break her password; all that she wrote would be safe, certainly from office gossips or other ne'er-do-wells. Of course, the encryption software meant nothing if the password wasn't secure. But who would ever think of a long word like <i>Carrickfergus</i> -- the small town where she'd grown up, in Ireland.<br><br>She had confided everything to her computer diary: her thoughts, her ideas, her suspicions. Suspicions. What a big word. Probably nothing she should worry about. Klimmer had been right. Not the sort of thing that should keep her up at night.<br><br>Not the sort of thing that would get her killed.<br><br>She lived in Denver, where the mountains met the plains in the middle of the continent and where seemingly all climatic conditions were possible within one twenty-four-hour period. She hailed from a place where the moderating currents of the Gulf Stream turned every day into a hazy rain, warm and temperate, even in winter. A place of fog and sea spray and men with flat caps; cows, sheep, stone walls, muck, slurry, more rain. The weather as predictable as bad news.<br><br>Even where her grandparents lived, in Allahabad, India, on the rolling brown plain along the Ganges, it wasn't hard to guess what the day would be like. Hot and dry nine months a year, hot and wet three. No mystery. Here, though, things were different. The mountains brought down snow and the deserts kicked up sand and the wide expanse of prairie could conjure up just about anything. They'd had drought for years, drought punctuated by big storms. Drive a few hours east and apparently a tornado could transport you to the wonderful land of Oz. Yes, here weather was weather, and thunderstorms and ball lightning and rains of frogs all seemed as likely to occur as anything else.<br><br>Perhaps she woke for a time. She told her mother she woke five or six times a night, having never really adapted to the wooden futon bed or the altitude or the aridity. Tonight it would actually be good that she was awake, she had only had about thirty minutes of consciousness left. Better to make the most of it.<br><br>She could have read the book next to her bed. Kerouac. Or she could have pulled on the toggle on the furry musical sheep that Hans Klimmer had given her. It played "Beautiful Dreamer" over and over and as it slowed and stopped perhaps she yawned and threw it on the floor.<br><br>Or maybe she looked out the window. She'd be surprised. A blizzard. She couldn't have been expecting that in June.<br><br>Monday, June 5, 1995, two-thirty Mountain Time...<br><br>At precisely the same moment, it was raining in Belfast, and the man who would eventually find Victoria's killer was not yet up.<br><br>Me.<br><br>I was half awake in a boat I'd broken into at Carrickfergus Marina, a girl with me whom I'd met in Dolan's the night before.<br><br>I was twenty-four, underweight, bearded, pale and sickly, with black curly hair that badly needed a cut. The girl: pretty, redheaded, skinny, and (unknown to me) only seventeen, at Carrickfergus Grammar School, a prefect, a member of the choir and scripture union but rebelling and well on her way to dropping out, failing her A levels, moving to Dublin and becoming a singer/model/prostitute/junkie. Breaking and entering and plying her with stolen gin would do nothing to alter the course of this trajectory.<br><br>And yet it was not such an illogical leap that, two weeks later, I'd be on my way west to the United States to investigate a murder that confused the local police. No, it wasn't so strange because in fact I'd been a detective for the Royal Ulster Constabulary -- Northern Ireland's police force. A copper for six years, a detective for three of those and a DC/DS for my last six months on the force. Those last six months the key to my current geographical, moral, physical, and spiritual condition.<br><br>Detective Constable/Drug Squad.<br><br>The girl rolled over sleepily in the bunk, went back to sleep. I stroked my beard and lit the remains of her joint. I never smoked pot, never, it made you stupid. My drug of choice...<br><br>But that's another story. Well, part of this one, but we'll get to that.<br><br>Still raining. Cold. Pissing down.<br><br>The boat stank. Why a boat? I couldn't go home -- my father, retired from teaching math, always bloody there. And her house was out of the question. The marina had an emergency turnstile locked with a Yale standard. Easy. You break in and you find a boat that looks expensive. The bunks were narrow, though, and there was no way to get warm unless you turned on the power on the dock but that would set off a light in the marina office. Suffer for your sin.<br><br>I had things to do but the rain had hypnotized me into apathy. I slid out of the bunk and went along the passage to the head. For it to work properly, you had to turn a cistern on, piss, pump it out, and turn it off again. A lot of effort. I went down there in my boxers, T-shirt, jacket. Trailing a duvet. Shivering. Smoking. A notice on the wall: "Trust in God and keep your bowels clean -- Cromwell." I regarded it for some time. Was it supposed to be funny? My brain felt addled.<br><br>I looked out through the thick glass. Pissing was right. The sort of gray, heavy downpour chief constables pray for during riot season. Not that I cared about it, not anymore. Nope, all over, done with. I was no longer part of the solution but had migrated to become part of the problem. I smiled.<br><br>I tugged the blanket around me. I smoked and rested my head against the bog wall. Something troubled me still. Something I didn't want to forget. I searched my memory and then the jacket pocket, but neither place revealed its mystery.<br><br>Sleep on it, I told myself.<br><br>I got up and walked to the chart table. I found the gin bottle and a square of Cadbury's chocolate from the night before. I threw the square in my mouth. Stale. I reached down again, found some fags, and lit one. Climbed in the bunk next to the girl.<br><br>Filthy habit, smoking in bed, for God's sake. I took a few puffs, coughed for half a minute, and added the cigarette to what I hoped was an ashtray lying down there.<br><br>I pulled the covers up over my head and kicked away a hot water bottle, icy and rubbery as a dead seal pup. I folded the duvet tighter. All now quiet -- only the easing rain on the window ledge and a drip, drip, drip coming from off the mainmast and down the hatch. The girl woke, whimpered. I slept....<br><br>And as the sky above eastern Ulster started to clear, on another continent, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and a thousand miles into the Great Plains, a wide, suffocating blanket of snow had closed down the railways, the highways, and every other road to all but the hardiest of souls. Cops, night shift workers, emergency personnel, stranded drivers, or the horde of high-altitude insomniacs staring through their windows.<br><br>And, of course, Victoria Patawasti's murderer.<br><br>Few vehicles moving, fewer people around, everywhere an eerie quiet.<br><br>Denver smothered in low clouds reflecting back the street and building lights, turning them sickly orange and neon red. Snow falling slantwise and hard but then diminishing as the pressure systems rotated around themselves in enormous anticlockwise ellipses. And in those moments of relative tranquillity, from high apartment windows came the peculiar sight of the snow falling upward, bobbing on heat thermals and heading into some icy purgatory in those awful clouds.<br><br>A truly impressive storm system that stretched from Canada all the way down into the Sangre de Cristos. Great swirls of low pressure that bounced off the Rockies and sucked up moisture from as far away as Puget Sound and the Gulf of California. The overnight man on the Weather Channel was dizzy with excitement. After a winter of drought, this was the biggest snowfall of the year. In fact, this was the biggest June storm since 1924, snow in six states, sixteen inches in Aspen, power outages in Utah, fourteen airports closed, all the east-west highways, America effectively cut in two, families trapped in cars, trucks overturned, El Ni�o, La Ni�a, Global Warming, Instability, the End Times, the Second Coming....<br><br>Not that it bothered Victoria's killer.<br><br>No, you didn't care, did you?<br><br>You had already murdered Alan Houghton up on Lookout Mountain.<br><br>And now it was three in the morning. Perfect. They say that that's when the body is at its weakest. The storm had come out of the blue. But it wouldn't matter. It would erase your footprints like a shaken Etch-A-Sketch. You probably liked the darkness, the low clouds, the fresh snow. The deciduous trees like scarecrows, the pine and spruce drenched in white. Trails on the path from people walking their dogs. Here and there a glimpse of the mountains. How long did you stand outside Victoria's apartment building?<br><br>You must have come in by the fire exit next to the garage. The only entrance that did not have a security camera. What would you have done if some old lady had spotted you down there?<br><br><i>You're going in late? Don't I know you? You're the</i> -- <br><br>You wouldn't hesitate. Jump down, rush her, kick the dog, take out the knife, slit her throat, knee drop on the dog, break its neck. That's the sort of thing you didn't want. Messy. Ugly. A whole night's adventures and you wouldn't even be in the building yet. And besides, you'd had quite the night already.<br><br>Absolutely no turning back now. Alan Houghton already dead. His body probably dumped in a quarry or under the extension of Interstate 70. What an effort that must have been for you, lifting his dead weight into the plastic sheeting in the trunk, driving through the snow, finding the trench you'd picked out yesterday. Necessary.<br><br>As was this.<br><br>Houghton had no proof of Charles's involvement in the murder but once the smear got out there it wouldn't go away. The bleeding had to stop. It had literally been millions of dollars over decades. If Charles was going to go anywhere, Houghton had to be silenced. And now with the first step taken, the job had to be finished. Oh, the surprise on his face. I'm sure he'd been expecting an envelope stuffed with benjamins....<br><br>The fire exit. You took out a magnet and greased it over the pass sensor. The light went green, the lock clicked. Easy as pie.<br><br>The door. A blast of heat. You rode the lift to the thirteenth floor.<br><br>Unlucky for some.<br><br>The apartment. You produced the copy of Victoria's key that you'd had ample time to make. You turned the lock. You applied the bolt cutters of the Leatherman multitool to the security chain. The chain snapped. You listened for a sound. Nothing. You opened the door.<br><br>You went into the apartment.<br><br>It wasn't your first time here.<br><br>It would be your last.<br><br>You closed the door behind you.<br><br>Smooth. Very smooth. You took out the revolver -- hopefully that wouldn't be necessary. You'd shot Alan far from anyone on Lookout Mountain. You'd probably met him there once before so that he wouldn't be suspicious. But even a .22 would make noise. Still, if you had to use it again you would. A superb gun. Handmade by Beretta in Italy, "from CM to AM with love" engraved in gold on the butt. Incriminating, to say the least. They'd never find Houghton, but even if you didn't have to use it on Victoria it would be safer to get rid of it.<br><br>You reached in your pocket and found Hector Martinez's driver's license. You dropped it near the door.<br><br>You took out the knife. Adjusted to the darkness.<br><br>The lights were off, but through the living room window you could see the storm had started up again. You walked across the living room. Opened the bedroom door. The humidifier glowed in the corner. The fan whirred. Victoria slept. So beautiful. Peaceful.<br><br>The knife glinted.<br><br>Victoria.<br><br>Breathing.<br><br>Closer.<br><br><i>Closer.</i><br><br>Her golden neck exposed to the ambient light. Victoria's carotid artery pulsing slightly. You gripped the knife tighter. A slash rather than a stab.<br><br>Closer. But something happened. A loud noise. Maybe you stood on something, a stuffed animal that moaned and played a bar of "Beautiful Dreamer."<br><br>Victoria sat up, opened her mouth to scream. But didn't scream. Instead maybe she smiled and said in a half question:<br><br>"Amber?"<br><br>The .22 flashed. A single bullet wiped out that pretty face forever.<br><br> � � �<br><br>I shivered. Suddenly woke. Looked around. The last of the rain drizzling down the portholes, weaving patterns and rivulets. The boat moving up and down against the dock. The halyards gently clanking against the metal mast.<br><br>"I'm going to be late for school," the girl said.<br><br>"School or college?" I said.<br><br>"School."<br><br>"Oh, God."<br><br>"I told ya last night," she said.<br><br>"How old are you?" I asked.<br><br>"Seventeen."<br><br>"I could go to prison," I groaned.<br><br>"Also for possession of cannabis resin, peddling controlled substances to a minor, criminal trespass, breaking and entering, theft, and a couple of other things," the girl said, getting up and lowering herself onto the floor.<br><br>She had red hair, curly, long, pale skin with freckles, and she looked a lot younger in the cold light, et cetera.<br><br>"How old are you?" she asked.<br><br>"Twenty-four, almost twenty-five."<br><br>"You look older."<br><br>"Thanks. So do you."<br><br>"Yeah, but you <i>really</i> look older."<br><br>"Aye, well, I'm a bad lad, hard living," I said, and fumbled for the smokes.<br><br>"Yeah right," she said, putting on her blouse. "Here, you want some coffee?"<br><br>"Sure. What time is it?"<br><br>"Just after ten. I've study until eleven, so no one will miss me," she said.<br><br>"Your parents?"<br><br>"Said I was staying at Jane's before I left."<br><br>"So you went out looking for trouble?"<br><br>She didn't reply. She went to the range and hit the gas. Struck a match on a ring, found some distilled water, put it in a pot. I got up on my elbow, swung my legs out.<br><br>"How do you know all the law stuff?"

Its stated purpose is "one of trying to show the effect of politics on AIDS and to some extent on science in general, and to provide an objective account of the risks of contracting AIDS and of the scope of the epidemic." Fumento's premise: "among the great wide percentage of the nation the media calls 'the general population,' that section the media and the public health authorities has tried desperately to terrify, there is no epidemic." Attempting to mollify the fears created by "alarmists," the author uses an insidiously homophobic, flippant style to heighten an "us verus them" attitude toward the crisis, claiming that the money spent on research and education is being siphoned from other more deserving diseases. Though Fumento throws a lot of statistics around, his argument is contradicted by the continuing spread of AIDS among heterosexuals. Not a balanced approach.<br><i>-James E. Van Buskirk, Acad . of Art Coll. Lib., San Francisco</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.The belief that AIDS is poised to break out widely among non-drug-abusing heterosexuals is a myth created by the media and public health officials, charges Fumento. This former AIDS analyst for the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights contends that estimates of the number of infected people, and of the risks to heterosexuals, have been grossly exaggerated, arguing further that the epidemic appears to be peaking. According to Fumento, two groups have fueled the alarmist myth: prudish conservative moralists and liberal "democratizers" eager to demonstrate that AIDS is not a "gay plague." His allegation that AIDS research has drained funds from the fight against cancer will outrage activists who want more federal dollars spent on AIDS. Among this polemic's more controversial or startling contentions is the assertion that the incidence of AIDS in Africa has been greatly overstated, and the claim that bisexuality among U.S. blacks and Hispanics, far more than that among whites, has played a major role in AIDS transmission. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Love Me Forever (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)</h2><p>Against the background of nineteenth-century England and Scotland, Kimberly Richards, a spirited heiress, objects when her father tries to marry her off to handsome Scot Lachlan MacGregor</p><p>Lachlan MacGregor, laird of clan MacGregor, needs a wealthy wife so he can restore his impoverished clan.

It includes accounts by congressmen C. Wright Patman and Hamilton Fish, as well as failed presidential candidate Alf M. Landon, who recalls what it was like to be governor of Kansas in 1933: <blockquote>Men with tears in their eyes begged for an appointment that would help save their homes and farms. I couldn't see them all in my office. But I never let one of them leave without my coming out and shakin' hands with 'em. I listened to all their stories, each one of 'em. But it was obvious I couldn't take care of all their terrible needs.</blockquote> The book includes also the perspectives of ordinary men and women, such as Jim Sheridan, who took part in the 1932 march by World War I veterans to petition for their benefits in Washington, D.C., where they were repelled by army troops led by General Douglas MacArthur. Or Edward Santander, who was a child then: "My first memories come about '31. It was simply a gut issue then: eating or not eating, living or not living."

All that and more is whimsically portrayed in a book that is more a chain reaction of events than a story. Still, there's plenty of bounce per ounce, which begins as a red-haired grandmother and her mustachioed husband get up and put in the turkey. Then the doorbell rings, and the tumult begins. Adults, children (many redheads), babies, and animals arrive and set the table, talk, knit, play instruments, and eat. After dinner, it's time for walking, washing, drying, a bit of crying, and dessert. The text, a line or so to a page, almost sounds as if it should be sung ("Ding-a-Ling! Grandma rings. Everyone come to the table!"). But it's the artwork that's the focus here, and sometimes there's so much activity, it's hard to believe that the figures are not really moving. There are several thin story lines to follow (What's that big wrapped present?), but kids probably won't pick them up until a welcome second or third reading. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

As &#34;The October Horse&#34; begins, Gaius Julius Caesar is at the height of his stupendous career. When he becomes embroiled in a civil war between Egypt&#39;s King Ptolemy and Queen Cleopatra, he finds himself torn between the fascinations of a remarkable woman and his duty as a Roman. Though he must leave Cleopatra, she remains a force in his life as a lover and as the mother of his only son, who can never inherit Caesar&#39;s Roman mantle, and therefore cannot solve his father&#39;s greatest dilemma -- who will be Caesar&#39;s Roman heir? A hero to all of Rome except to those among his colleagues who see his dictatorial powers as threats to the democratic system they prize so highly, Caesar is determined not to be worshiped as a god or crowned king, but his unique situation conspires to make it seem otherwise. Swearing to bring him down, Caesar&#39;s enemies masquerade as friends and loyal supporters while they plot to destroy him. Among them are his cousin and Master of the Horse, Mark Antony, feral and avaricious, priapic and impulsive; Gaius Trebonius, the nobody, who owes him everything; Gaius Cassius, eaten by jealousy; and the two Brutuses, his cousin Decimus, and Marcus, the son of his mistress Servilia, sad victim of his mother and of his uncle Cato, whose daughter he marries. All are in Caesar&#39;s debt, all have been raised to high positions, all are outraged by Caesar&#39;s autocracy. Caesar must die, they decide, for only when he is dead will Rome return to herold ways, her old republican self. With her extraordinary knowledge of Roman history, Colleen McCullough brings Caesar to life as no one has ever done before and surrounds him with an enormous and vivid cast of historical characters, characters like Cleopatra who call to us from beyond the centuries, for McCullough&#39;s genius is to make them live again without losing any of the grandeur that was Rome. Packed with battles on land and sea, with intrigue, love affairs, and murders, the novel moves with amazing speed toward the assassination itself, and then into the ever more complex and dangerous consequences of that act, in which the very fate of Rome is at stake. &#34;The October Horse&#34; is about one of the world&#39;s pivotal eras, relating as it does events that have continued to echo even into our own times.</p><p><b>Colleen Mccullough</b> was born in Australia. A neurophysiologist, she established the department of neurophysiology at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, then worked as a researcher and teacher at Yale Medical School for ten years. Her writing career began with the publication of <i>Tim,</i> followed by <i>The Thorn Birds,</i> a record-breaking international bestseller. The author of ten other novels, McCullough has also written lyrics for musical theater. She lives on Norfolk Island in the South Pacific with her husband, Ric Robinson.<p><b>Introduction</b> </p><p> The Ides of October marked the end of the campaigning season, and on that day a race was held on the grassy sward of the Campus Martius, just outside the Servian Walls of Republican Rome. </p><p> The year's best war horses were harnessed in pairs to chariots and driven at breakneck pace; the right-hand one of the winning pair became the October Horse, and was ritually killed with a spear by the <i>flamen Martialis,</i> the special priest of Mars, who was god of war. Then the October Horse's head and genitalia were amputated. The genitals were rushed to bleed on the sacred hearth in the Regia, Rome's oldest temple, after which they were given to the Vestal Virgins to burn to ashes in the sacred flame of Vesta; later these ashes were mixed into cakes offered on the anniversary of the founding of Rome by her first king, Romulus. The decorated head was tossed into the midst of two teams of humble citizens, one from the Subura district, one from the Sacra Via district, who fought strenuously for possession of it. If the Subura won, the head was nailed to the Turris Mamilia. If the Sacra Via won, the head was nailed to an outer wall of the Regia. </p><p> In this ritual so old that no one remembered how it had begun, the very best that Rome owned was sacrificed to the twin powers that ruled her: war and land. Out of them came her might, her prosperity, her everlasting glory. The death of the October Horse was at once a mourning of the past and a vision of the future. </p><p> Copyright � 2002 by Colleen McCullough</p></p><h2>DK Eyewitness Europe (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><b><i>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Europe</i></b> will lead you straight to the best attractions this diverse continent has to offer, from the majestic peaks of the Alps to the turquoise waters of the Mediterranean.</p><p>This newly updated guidebook is packed with information on the culture, history, architecture, and art of the continent, in addition to the best of Europe's gardens, beaches, cathedrals, castles, and shopping.

Friar Alberoni, who is trying to track down the fabled Christian ruler Prester John, hires Zuliani to accompany him on a journey to Kublai Khan&#39;s legendary city of Xanadu. Narrator Gordon Griffin&#39;s enthusiastic approach is just right for the irrepressible Zuliani, who has a keen eye for the beauties of Xanadu--female, scenic, and material. While Zuliani imagines the riches of the Mongol empire filling his pockets, what he actually encounters is treachery, palace intrigue, personal danger, and murder.

S.J.H. � AudioFile 2010, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Salvage: Poems</h2><p>How do we transform the wreckage of our identities? Cynthia Dewi Oka&#x2019;s evocative collection answers this question by brimming with what we salvage from our most deep-seated battles. Reflecting the many dimensions of the poet&#x2019;s life, <i>Salvage</i> manifests an intermixture of aesthetic forms that encompasses multiple social, political, and cultural contexts&#x2014;leading readers to Bali, Indonesia, to the Pacific Northwest, and to South Jersey and Philadelphia.<br><br> Throughout it insistently interrogates what it means to reach for our humanity through the guises of nation, race, and gender. Oka&#x2019;s language transports us through the many bodies of fluid poetics that inhabit our migrating senses and permeate across generations into a personal diaspora. <i>Salvage</i> invites us to be without borders.</p><p><p><b>CYNTHIA DEWI OKA </b>is the author of <i>Nomad of Salt</i> and <i>Hard Water</i>. Originally from Bali, Indonesia, she is a two-time Pushcart Prize nominee and a recipient of the Fifth Wednesday Journal Editor&#x2019;s Prize in Poetry as well as grants from the Leeway Foundation and Vermont Studio Center. Oka is an alumnus of Voices of Our Nations (VONA) and her work has appeared in the anthologies <i>Dismantle</i>, <i>Read Women</i>, and <i>Revolutionary Mothering</i>. She is based in the greater Philadelphia area, where she works as a community organizer with immigrant and faith communities.</p><i>&#x201c;Salvage</i> is a necessary collection of poems that steadily pushes us not only to witness our world and surroundings, but to engage with both the stunning and the brutal, to hold both the dirt and the beauty, to oscillate between the guttural and the want, and to look so deeply at love and how it can sometimes erupt and feel broken &#x2013; how to keep honoring it.&#x201d; &#x2013;Ellen Hagan, author of <i>Hemisphere: Poems </i><br><br> "So much beauty is made from sorrow in this book, while silence 'swarms like beetles.'&nbsp;Here is an escape from 'our slanderous past taking / root in potholed sidewalks,'&nbsp;and here also the litany of arrival in North American suburbia, where Orpheus is mugged in the city of brotherly love and even Lazarus reconsiders his awakening. This book&nbsp;gives us both the refugee's map of North America&nbsp;<i>and</i>&nbsp;a window to the world beyond. I love this book's invention, as Dewi Oka summons up the courage to rage and grieve: 'Let memory make of me a scream that wasn't there.'&nbsp;What a powerful plea! I love the many kinds of tenderness on these pages, Dewi Oka's attentiveness to detail, the wonderful gift of seeing poetry in the custodial, in the tragic: so even if tears come, they are 'like small stubborn / gods refusing to fall.'&nbsp;I love the mythical depth,&nbsp;the civic outcry, the lyric inventiveness of these poems. But most of all, I love how how beautifully music is made patiently from the sorrow, how a human 'holds his breath, secretly / chains to a single note all the mutinies inside him--'.&nbsp;A powerful book.&nbsp;&#x2013;Ilya Kaminsky, author of <i>Dancing in Odessa&nbsp;</i><br><br>"The gods of poetry occasionally are lavish with their gifts, choosing to endow a writer with special access to their mysteries: Cynthia Dewi Oka is such a one, a migrant whose powerful poems embody and defy history&#x2019;s savage dislocations. From a world lost where 'houses/ shudder like goats at the stockyard' to the irony of 'a land where milk and honey can sweeten fear,' her depth-charged vision is a seemingly inexhaustible source of eloquent, revelatory images."&nbsp;&#x2013;Eleanor Wilner&nbsp;<br><br>"Cynthia Dewi&nbsp;Oka's work is full of 'the kind of beauty that incinerates/the shelter of the body,' bringing it (us) closer to the wall-less wilds where every thing is kin. She reminds us that 'to salvage' is to, with profound effort, transform loss into possibility. In this way, the poems are species of invention and surrender, ceremonies of memory and reckoning.

Nor does he tell her about the frightening sensation he has in the pool of hands clutching at him, trying to pull him under.

First from the standpoint of its pedagogic value, those of us who teach the history of Germany in this period are well aware of a serious problem: there has been no up-to-date, accessible, synthetic text which we can assign our student...Berghahns volume fills this void in commendable fashion. Organized thematically rather chronologically, it deals in turn with the economy, society, culture, and politics. It is erudite and well written, ant it is filled with detail and biographical vignettes that successfully advance Berghahns thematic constructs... -- <i>The Historian</i><br><br>Volker Berghahn has a long established reputation as one of the foremost experts on the Wilhelmine empire, and it is gratifying to have now a substantial treatment from him of Germany in that period, or at least until 1914...

Married 32 years, with three grown kids, she has had a good life with an understanding mate, one who has supported her lifelong writing habit.<p>"I've always loved to write." says Pam, an Issaquah, Washington resident and office manager at Chinook Middle School. "Poetry, short stories...I cannot remember a time when I didn't like to write or read."</p><p>Binder's path to her destiny was circuitous. As she raised her children, she put her writing career on hold. But old-fashioned diligence and a chance meeting with a receptive agent, changed her life.</p><p>When Pam Binder was a kid, a fifth grade teacher told her mother: "Pam's reading too much. She's reading during recess." Her mother retorted that she didn't consider her daughter's love of reading grounds for complaint.</p><p>About ten years ago, Pam decided she wanted to start writing again in earnest. She went to a Romance Writers of America conference. Then she signed up for the commercial fiction writing sequence at the University of Washington's extension division.</p><p>It was there that things fell into place.</p><p>Jack Remick, one of Pam's teachers in the UW program, referred to a book called. <i>The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers</i> by Christopher Vogler. Based on the teachings of Joseph Campbell, the book teaches that most compelling stories, from the screenplay of <i>Pretty Woman</i> to Homer's <i>The Odyssey,</i> have the same elements:</p><p></p><blockquote>1)The Quest -- the physical or emotional journey taken by the protagonist.<p> 2)The Dragon -- the conflict the main character must endure, or surmount.</p><p> 3)A resolution that comes back to the beginning of the hero's quest.</p></blockquote><p>Pam learned that a story is "not a straight line, but a circle." When a character returns to his or her starting point "they're completely different, emotionally transformed."</p><p>"It was like a light bulb went off," Pam said. After traveling to Scotland on vacation with her husband, a story fermenting in her imagination suddenly came together and began to gel. The result was <i>The Inscription,</i> a time travel romance set in 16th century Scotland. Her book features a clan of immortals and a modern American teacher named Amber MacPhee who is pulled into their world of mystery, romance and adventure.</p><p>Pam's next class at the University was taught by the owner of a small regional press. P.R. Goodfellow bought Pam's work-in-progress, printed 2,000 copies of it in 1997 and sold them all.</p><p>If that were the end of the story, this would be a respectable happier-ever-after piece. It's not.</p><p>In 1998, Pam took the Goodfellow Press edition of <i>The Inscription</i> to the Pacific Northwest Writers' Association summer conference. More or less at random, Binder took the book to Liza Dawson, a New York literary agent. Dawson "patted my hand," Pam recalls, took the book on the plane and called her Monday morning.</p><p>"I can sell this," Dawson told Pam.</p><p>Dawson says she has a test for any book: "Am I having a really, really good time?" She recalls her immediate reaction to <i>The Inscription:</i> "I so much enjoyed reading that book. It's a bear of a trip from Seattle to Newark. I found myself laughing, enjoying it...it came as a surprise because I hadn't had any expectations." Though Dawson enjoys mixing with authors at such conferences, finding a saleable one is a relatively rare event.</p><p>Dawson sold <i>The Inscription</i> and another book by Pam Binder, <i>The Quest,</i> to Pocket. <i>The Quest</i> will be released in August 2000 under Pocket/Sonnet. It is also a time travel: A Celtic sorceress needs a warrior to free her mother; however, when she cast a spell, the man who appears is, Kenneth MacKinnon, a professional football player from the 21st century. For the first time in his life he is not in control of the situation.</p><p>What is this lesson in this happy ending?</p><p>Endurance, perhaps. Pam says she has a quality that approximates the "cone of silence" of Maxwell Smart on the old <i>Get Smart</i> television show -- she can block out anything and write anytime, everywhere. Writing on a regular legal pad, she writes during her lunch break. After work, she goes to Barnes &amp; Noble and writes there. She credits her UW instructors for teaching her that you don't have to write in sequence. Write an adventure sequence when you feel like it -- write romance when the spirit moves you.</p><p>In fact, not a lot has changed since that fifth-grader was chastised for reading during recess. Pam's need to read and write endures. "I look at it as small steps", she says. "As a writer, you need to look at the long term."</p><p><i>The Inscription</i> received 4 and a half stars and a <i>Romantic Times</i> Top Pick award in their February Review: "...Readers will be drawn in by Pam Binder's magic touch for blending the natural with the supernatural and creating a spellbinding tale with many subplots, wonderful historical backdrop and color, and the added attraction of the Highlander immortal. This is truly a love story for the ages."<br><br><b>Patricia Cabot</b> is a critically acclaimed and prolific author. "It is a true joy to listen to Patricia Cabot's unique voice," raved <i>Romantic Times.</i> She is also the author the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Princess Diaries series, which she writes as Meg Cabot. Patricia Cabot lives in New York City with her husband.</p><p><b>Chapter One</b><br> </p><p> Tyler Stevens set her coffee cup down on the glass-topped table, then dropped her head back against the wrought-iron chair, closed her eyes, and let the sun warm her skin. </p><p> "Playing Aunt Tyler again today?" came a voice she knew well. </p><p> "Yes!" Tyler said, smiling, but not opening her eyes. </p><p> "And wouldn't you rather saunter downtown to Union Square to pick up some fresh fruit and homemade muffins? Or wander about Central Park on this glorious day?" </p><p> "No," she said, then looked across her terrace at Barry. When she'd bought her apartment three years ago, she'd been concerned because her terrace was separated from her neighbor's by only a foot. Like the New Yorker she'd become, she was worried about privacy. But for a year she'd never even once seen the little old man who owned the apartment, and then he moved to Scarsdale to live with his daughter. When the apartment had been purchased by an unmarried man, Tyler had been concerned. Was she going to be fending off the attentions of some guy who wore gold chains? Or would he be a computer nerd and Tyler was his fantasy? </p><p> But when she'd seen Barry and saw that he wasn't going to be interested in<i> her,</i> she'd been enthusiastic in her welcome. Barry owned a tiny, exclusive florist shop downtown, and within three months after he'd moved in, his terrace was lush with roses and greenery. </p><p> Then, about seven months after he'd moved in, he was sued by a young man who'd worked for him, and, even though it wasn't her field of expertise, Tyler had handled the case. The suit hadn't taken much of her time, and she wanted to be friendly with her neighbor, so when Barry had asked for her bill, Tyler had waved her hand. "Don't worry about it," she'd said. </p><p> Two weeks later, she'd returned from a business trip, and when she looked across her living room onto her terrace, she saw that it had been transformed into a beautiful garden of flowers, greenery, and even little trees in pots. Openmouthed, she was standing in the middle of the garden, staring, when Barry had leaned over the railing and said, "Like it?" </p><p> That had been the beginning of their friendship. Even though she'd been his lawyer on the case (and had won it), she'd kept her professionalism and they had shared little talk of their personal lives. But after Barry had transformed Tyler's boring terrace into a wonderland, they'd become friends. And after Barry had seen that Tyler didn't know how to take care of a garden, Barry had had a tiny bridge, complete with railings, made. He could slip the bridge into place so he could walk across to Tyler's terrace and weed and water. It wasn't long before the bridge never came down and they were taking care of each other's mail and even phone calls while the other was occupied. </p><p> Since, like so many New Yorkers, they were from other parts of the country, in a short time, they each became the only family in the city that the other had. </p><p> But that was until six months ago when Tyler's cousin, Kristin Beaumont, had moved to New York. Krissy's father was Tyler's mother's older brother, but, more than that, he was their "savior." Or at least that's what Tyler's mother always called him. When Tyler's father had been killed in an accident when Tyler was six, it was Uncle Thaddeus who'd stepped in and taken over. Tyler's father had been too young to think about such things as life insurance, so he'd left behind a penniless wife and child. </p><p> But Uncle Thad had opened his heart and his bank account. He'd paid for everything while his little sister went back to school and got her degree in elementary education. And years later, when young Tyler had shown interest in Uncle Thad's law profession, he'd encouraged her, and when she said she wanted to go to law school, he'd paid for every penny of her education. </p><p> So now, Uncle Thad had asked Tyler to "keep an eye on" his daughter when she moved to big, bad New York. Once a week Tyler went to Krissy's apartment for Sunday dinner. Tyler very much enjoyed the time spent with her young cousin. However, there was one teeny, tiny drawback: Krissy was the worst cook on the face of the earth. </p><p> "So what's on the menu today?" Barry asked, a watering can in his hand. </p><p> "Rocks, for all I know," Tyler said, shaking her head in disbelief. "The girl can take the finest cut of meat in the world and turn it into granite." </p><p> "No luck in introducing her to carry-out?" </p><p> "None. She says that if she wants to be a wife and mother, then she must learn to cook." </p><p> "Still on that, is she?" Barry asked as he stepped up onto the bridge, then walked over and began to inspect Tyler's plants. "No hope in...?" </p><p> "If you mean, is there any hope of turning her away from her obsession with her boss? As far as I can tell, there's no hope at all!" Tyler picked up her coffee cup again, saw that it was empty, then put it down. Uncle Thad had used his influence to obtain a high-level position for his beloved daughter as the personal assistant of Joel Kingsley, the founder and owner of the chain of DIY stores called Home Stores. Almost immediately after starting work, Krissy had decided that she was madly, passionately, and insanely in love with her charismatic boss. Never mind that Joel Kingsley was in his forties and Krissy was just twenty-three. And never mind that as far as Tyler could find out, Joel Kingsley didn't seem to think of Krissy as anything except an employee; Krissy still believed she was in love with him. </p><p> And as a result, Joel Kingsley was all that Krissy talked about. All. That's it. There had been three dinners in which not a word was uttered about anything other than Joel Kingsley. </p><p> Tyler had now spent twenty-four Sunday dinners with her cousin, and while trying to eat Krissy's inedible food, she'd had to hear everything there was to hear about Joel Kingsley. </p><p><br> For the first three visits, Tyler had tried to reason with her young cousin. She'd smiled indulgently. Krissy's gushing about her new job and, especially, about her new boss had made Tyler feel much, much older than her thirty-five years. "I'm sure that Mr. Kingsley" -- she used the <i>Mr.</i> to emphasize the age difference -- "is dashing compared to someone from back home, but -- " </p><p> "Oh, Tyler," Krissy had gushed, "you've never seen him. He's so...so wonderful. He walks like...I mean, he...And he...Oh, you just have to see him to understand." </p><p> Tyler gave a weak smile. In her field of domestic relations -- a "divorce lawyer," as she was more commonly called -- she'd seen lots of men who walked like...And were so...But she'd also seen the way these dynamic men tried to leave the women with nothing after the divorce. </p><p> "And how many times has he been married?" Tyler asked quietly as she used the serrated knife to saw at the meat that Krissy had served her. </p><p> "Once, but that's all," Krissy said quickly. "Except for one other time." </p><p> "Does that mean that he's been married twice?" She was still trying to cut the meat but was having no luck. </p><p> "If you want to get technical, it does," Krissy said defensively, "but I'm not sure that first marriages count." </p><p> "They all count in a courtroom." Tyler's index finger was bending back painfully so she gripped the knife handle in her fist. </p><p> "You're too much like Daddy. You're too cynical. Would you like a spoon for that?" </p><p> "Spoon?" Tyler said, looking up, not understanding. </p><p> "For your macaroni and cheese," Krissy said as though Tyler were stupid. </p><p> Tyler looked down at the slab of black on her plate. "This is -- ?" she started, then stopped herself. She put down her knife and fork. "Krissy, honey, I know that New York must be exhilarating to you, and I'm sure that a self-made man like Joel Kingsley must be wildly exciting, but -- " </p><p> "He's <i>not</i> exciting," Krissy said. "He works too hard to have time for anything except business. He never takes time off, and he does everything, oversees everything. If you saw him in the office...There isn't anything anywhere that is too small for him to notice." </p><p> Control freak, Tyler thought but didn't say. She couldn't help but look down at her plate. Macaroni and cheese? she thought, trying her best to see if she could make out the curve of the pasta. How did one get cheese to harden like that? She'd heard of blackened fish, but blackened <i>cheese?</i> </p><p> She looked back at Krissy. "There are a couple of young men in our office who I'd like you to meet." </p><p> At that Krissy angrily stood up, removed their plates, and disappeared into the kitchen. Her father had purchased his "baby" daughter an apartment. That the apartment cost more than Tyler's and that it had been professionally decorated, while Tyler's furniture had mostly come from auctions and estate sales, did rankle a bit. "Makes you, as Scarlett said, 'Pea green with envy,'" Barry had said when Tyler first described the place. "Of course if you didn't do so much <i>pro bono</i> work, you could afford an apartment like that," Barry had added fondly. </p><p> After that first Sunday luncheon, Tyler had done some research on Joel Kingsley. Unexpectedly, she'd found out that he seemed a nice enough guy. The truth was, that Tyler had expected to be told that he preyed on young and innocent girls. But, as Krissy had said, Joel Kingsley had been married when he was in college, but the marriage had broken apart just a year later. He'd remarried two years after he'd graduated and that liaison had lasted for fifteen years. </p><p> Tyler had called someone who had given her the number of someone else, so she'd gradually found a person who knew a little bit more about Joel Kingsley than was written in <i>Forbes</i> magazine. According to her informant, after fifteen years of being a "business widow," Joel Kingsley's second wife had divorced him and run off with her personal trainer. "Kingsley was generous in the settlement," Tyler had been told. "But Celeste Delashaw has her hands on him now." </p><p> "And who is Celeste Delashaw?" Tyler had asked. </p><p> "You aren't in the museum set, are you?" </p><p> "If you're asking me if I spend my free time going to thousand-dollar-a-plate benefits, no, I don't," Tyler had said more snappishly than she'd meant to. </p><p> "Neither do I, but I <i>read</i> about them," her informant had snapped back. </p><p> Tyler didn't reply to that. She hadn't much time to spare for reading about "society." And, besides, too many of her cases dealt with women who'd put men through school, while raising their children almost single-handedly. Finally, when the kids were out of the house and the man was a success, the wife was ready to enjoy what she'd worked for, but too often, the man then dumped her for a younger woman. Tyler had seen too many of these fifty-something women who were facing bleak futures alone. </p><p> "Celeste Delashaw is the former wife of Maximilian Aldrich. You have heard of him, haven't you?" </p><p> Tyler had looked at her watch. She was due in court in fifteen minutes. Thank heaven she was on her cell phone; she picked up her pace. "Sure. Steel." </p><p> "As in cars, boats, and planes." </p><p> "All I want to know is the character of this man, Joel Kingsley. My young cousin works for him and she has a serious crush on him. Is he likely to take advantage of her?" </p><p> There was a pause on the other end of the phone. "I haven't heard those terms since I left Iowa. 'Crush.' 'Take advantage of her.' Are you asking that if she looks at him in invitation, is he likely to tell her that he loves her just so he can screw her on top of the copy machine?" </p><p> "More or less," Tyler said, her lips tight at such a thought about her beloved cousin. </p><p> "Not as long as Celeste Delashaw is after him, he won't." </p><p> "What about <i>him?!"</i> Tyler said in exasperation. "Not her. Him!" </p><p> "Keep your shirt on. I haven't heard anything like that about him. His wife left him because she never saw him, not because he was making the secretaries. However, he is a man. What's your cousin look like?" </p><p> Tyler didn't want to answer that. "Thanks," she said. "I owe you one"; then she pushed the "end" button on the phone and cut off the connection. </p><p> But, honestly, after that conversation Tyler wasn't much better off than she had been before. Joel Kingsley might be a good guy, but he was rich and powerful and he was probably surrounded with girls like Krissy who adored him. He wasn't married, but he was dating a rich woman who seemed to be protective of her "property." </p><p> "So why don't you take some food with you when you go?" Barry was saying now. </p><p> "I tried that. She puts it in the refrigerator and serves what she's cooked. Barry, what am I going to do about this? Uncle Thad expects me to oversee my cousin, but she's developed this infatuation with a man nearly twice her age. Krissy has always been so sheltered. She has no idea what can happen to her in this world." </p><p> "And you do?" Barry asked cynically. "It seems to me that you two are at opposite ends of the world. Your little cousin thinks that men can do no wrong, while you spend your days dealing with men whose only concern is how much wrong they can do." </p><p> "You aren't going to start on my love life again, are you?" she said, picking up her coffee cup, then standing. She was still wearing her heavy terry-cloth bathrobe. </p><p> "Can't start on something that doesn't exist, can I?" Barry called after her as she went inside the apartment. </p><p> Once inside her apartment, Tyler looked at the clock. There wasn't time to have another cup of coffee and to continue exchanging gibes with Barry. She had to get dressed to go to her cousin's for Sunday dinner. </p><p> Forty-five minutes later, Tyler was standing outside Krissy's apartment door and ringing the bell. The doorman had let her up, but now Krissy wasn't answering. Like the overprotective aunt Barry accused her of being, Tyler was instantly worried. Digging into her handbag, she removed the key to Krissy's apartment that she kept there for "emergencies." </p><p> Once inside, Tyler saw that there were no lights on in the apartment and there was no smell of burned food coming from the kitchen. In fact, when Tyler went into the kitchen, it was clean and neat, with no signs of food preparation. But the perfectly clean kitchen only added to Tyler's fears, for Krissy was a very conscientious young woman. If she invited someone to dinner, she'd not forget. </p><p> When Tyler heard a sound like a kitten mewling coming from the bedroom, she began to run down the hall, her heels clicking on Krissy's inlaid hardwood floors. </p><p> When Tyler pushed open Krissy's bedroom door, she gasped, for there was Krissy lying in bed, her face pink with what looked like fever. Around her were three boxes of tissues, with a pile of used tissues on the floor. On the bedside table were four brown plastic bottles of pills, a thermometer, and two bottles of water. </p><p> When Krissy looked up at Tyler, she said, "I'm sick," in a congested voice. </p><p> "Why didn't you tell me?" Tyler said, annoyed but relieved to have found her cousin at last, as she felt Krissy's forehead. It was warm but not burning. "Why didn't you call me earlier? I would have come over and taken care of ...</p></p><h2>North America (A True Book: Geography: Continents)</h2><p><b>North America is a beautiful continent with sprawling land that encompasses everything from icy tundra and green forests to bone-dry deserts and rocky mountain peaks.</b><br><br>A True Book: Geography series dives into the many components that make each continent distinctive and exceptional.

Spong is careful to acknowledge previous scholars and to distinguish fact or knowledge from speculation. He encourages a midrashish or imaginative approach to the Gospels and points out how literalism of scripture and creed in the Virgin Mary references led to sexism in church teaching.

In an era when tracks were rough and safety precautions virtually unknown, Rickenbacker pushed the fastest machines at terrifying speeds. Later in life, he would own the Indianapolis Speedway and help establish the sport of modern race car driving as we know it.<br><br>But Rickenbacker&#x2019;s lasting fame came as an &#x201c;Ace of Aces&#x201d; in World War I, a fearless fighter pilot who would chase the &#x201c;Flying Circus&#x201d; of the legendary Red Baron above the battlefields of France. With his &#x201c;Hat-in-the-Ring&#x201d; squadron, Eddie was among the first to understand that the new technology of aviation would forever change the face of warfare. Shooting down twenty-six enemy planes in just seven months, he captured the hearts of a nation back home involved in its first Great War.<br><br>Even after the war, he remained a national figure as one of the founders of Eastern Airlines. Turning his wartime experience to peacetime industry, Rickenbacker again led American interests in reshaping the world. And in one of the most dramatic chapters of World War II, a plane on which Rickenbacker flew as a civilian crash-landed in the Pacific Ocean.

His chest felt full of heavy air, as if a gorgon swarm were sitting on it.</p><p>He told himself it would be okay. In fifty-four seconds Augustus would be laughing at him and asking him to explain why he opened fire on an unarmed, manned vessel, and John Farragut would be feeling ridiculous. He never imagined wanting so badly to be ridiculous.</p><p>He searched for Jose Maria on deck. Wanted to say to him: Here&#x2019;s to Augustus laughing.</p><p>He felt a presence immediately behind him. A touch, a breath on his hair. A kiss on his neck.</p><p>And he was angry. A line crossed and never expected. Farragut&#x2019;s hair prickled, face burned. He did not appreciate the gesture, and the timing stunk. It pissed him enough to snap around from the face of the imminent Judgment and demand, &#x201c;What was <i>that?</i>&#x201d;</p><p>Augustus elled his thumb and forefinger against his opposing palm, flipped a quick word in American Sign: <i>Later</i>.</p><p>John Farragut felt himself go wide-eyed.

Crushing the tremor out of his voice, he commanded quietly, &#x201c;Now, I think.&#x201d;</p><p>Because he sensed Augustus had no intention of <i>ever</i> explaining that. For all Augustus&#x2019; talk of the immutability of time, Farragut got the feeling Augustus did not expect one or both of them to be here thirty seconds from now, and <i>that</i> had been an end-of-the-world stunt Augustus need not live with for more than thirty seconds.</p><p>His eyes were suddenly not blank at all. Always, when plugged in, Augustus&#x2019; eyes became vacant hollows, the thoughts racing deep inside. This time they looked back, aware, omniscient. The patterner had taken in all, synthesized all the minutiae, and saw what he had not seen before this moment.</p><p>Farragut stared at him. <i>You just recanted!</i></p><p>Saw the answer in his eyes.<br><br>* * *&nbsp;</p><p><i>MUNDI TERMINUM ADPROPINQUANTE</i>. <i>Now that we are approaching the end of the world, John Farragut.</i></p><p><i>Your individual existence is a statistical miracle. We are, each and every one of us, highly improbable, a one-in-a-million event at conception. History turns on a space big enough for angels to dance on. I do stand by inevitability.</i> <i>But inevitability works on a macroscopic scale. Macroscopic events are inevitable. The blizzard will come. But the when, the where, and the unique shape of each snowflake is a function of chaos. One breath out of place, and that one singular snowflake never forms. I mistook us for macroscopic</i>. <i>Intuition is subconscious knowledge, and while logic says changing history is impossible, intuition says there are things beyond my ken; and you are a patterner, John Farragut. You know. You </i>know<i>.</i> <i>And you&#x2019;re right. You are chaos. I won&#x2019;t explain later, because there is no later. There is no earlier. There is no time at all. Simply put, it was miraculous knowing you, and that was good-bye.</i></p><p>So said the eyes. Aloud, Augustus answered with an ironic near smile, &#x201c;I still think you&#x2019;re an idiot.&#x201d;</p><p>But Farragut understood him as clearly as if he&#x2019;d spoken all of it.</p><p><i>I&#x2019;m right!</i></p><p>The floor of the world kicked out from under him. This was the end of the world he knew.</p><p>Did not want to be right.</p><p>He faced forward, terrified now. The countdown fell on cotton ears.</p><p>&#x201c;Arran messenger ten seconds from the gate. Nine. Eight.&#x201d;</p><p><i>There is no later</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s accelerating again.&#x201d; The count sped up. &#x201c;We have four seconds. Three. Two. Messenger at the gate&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Closed his eyes.</p><p><i>Oh, God, it&#x2019;s done. If it happens, it will be this instant. I won&#x2019;t even know. Either I&#x2019;m here or I&#x2019;m not, and I never was.</i></p><p>Breathed.<br><b>PART ONE</b><br><b>Labyrinth&nbsp;<br><br>1</b></p><p>COLONEL TR STEELE didn&#x2019;t know where he was. He didn&#x2019;t know who he was or what he was. He had the sense of nearing a surface, which suggested he was under something. It was dark. He wasn&#x2019;t breathing. But he had a heartbeat.</p><p>He neared consciousness while they were moving him. Didn&#x2019;t know who <i>they</i> were. His eyelids fluttered. He heard, as if through thick gauze, concerned murmurs from the people lifting him. One voice sounded sudden alarm, but Steele couldn&#x2019;t understand the words.</p><p>What language was that?</p><p><i>Did I crash?</i></p><p>The last thing Colonel Steele knew, he&#x2019;d been in the cockpit of his fighter Swift, lining up his approach to dock with the United States Space Battleship <i>Merrimack</i>.</p><p>And now he wasn&#x2019;t.</p><p>He had a sense of time having passed. But how long? Hours? He had a bad feeling that it was longer than hours.</p><p>How did he get here? Where was here?</p><p>Was that voice speaking <i>Latin?</i></p><p>Oh, hell, he was sinking back into red-black nothingness.</p><p>Where was the <i>Merrimack?</i></p><p>And where the hell was Kerry Blue?<br><br>* * *&nbsp;</p><p>5 January 2448<br>U.S. Space Battleship <i>Merrimack<br></i>Indra Aleph Star System<br>Perseid Space</p><p>The universe was all wrong.</p><p>Rumor had it that Flight Sergeant Kerry Blue had married the Old Man.</p><p><i>Yeah, right</i>. A flight sergeant married to a full bird colonel? Not in this man&#x2019;s Fleet Marine. Flight Sergeant Shasher Wyatt wasn&#x2019;t idiot enough to believe that squid story. And the idea of Kerry Blue married to anyone? In what universe?</p><p>But how then to explain how Kerry Blue went from anybody&#x2019;s port in a storm to sleeping alone in her own pod?</p><p>Kerry Blue was pretty. Okay, fine, she was what passed for pretty on a space battleship patrolling the edge of nowhere. The longer <i>Merrimack </i>stayed out here at the galactic rim, the prettier Kerry Blue got. She had it all over those perfect lindas in the dreambox for being real. But you could have one of those dream babes anytime&#x2014;anytime you were off duty. You couldn&#x2019;t have Kerry Blue anymore, anytime, at all. That hurt. And for some stupid reason it made her more wantable.</p><p>And then there was Cain Salvador&#x2014;<i>Lieutenant</i> Cain Salvador, if you can believe that&#x2014;acting like her daddy with a shotgun. You touch Kerry Blue on pain of, well, pain. The rumor was that Cain had been best man at the supposed wedding. But just ask him if that was true and Acting Wing Commander Cain Salvador would order you to do something anatomically unacceptable involving a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, anyway. Cain was not the problem. The Kerry Blue of old could get around any chaperone God ever invented. The problem was that Kerry Blue didn&#x2019;t want to get around Cain. She really did act like she was holding a docking beacon for the one man who wasn&#x2019;t on board. And when Kerry Blue fixed on one guy, the rest of you lot were so not screwed.</p><p>So the only ball Flight Sergeant Shasher Wyatt got to play with Kerry Blue involved a hoop.</p><p>It was Team Alpha versus Team Baker in the starboard maintenance hangar. The Bakers were swabbing the deck with the Alphas, who were not tall.</p><p>Alpha Six, Kerry Blue, jumped for the basketball.</p><p>So did Geneva Rhine, Alpha Three, the one they called Rhino. Rhino was an upholstered boulder with a cute elfin face. Rhino slammed into Kerry Blue like&#x2014;well, not like a charging sugarplum fairy. And Rhino and Blue were on the same team. Just the sound could knock the air out of you.</p><p>Shasher Wyatt winced.<br><br>* * *&nbsp;</p><p>Kerry Blue came down from the jump, breathless and ball-less. Her feet missed the deck. She landed on her back and rolled. Shasher Wyatt staggered. An alarm clanged.</p><p>The status panel flashed red. Shasher Wyatt was over Kerry Blue, trying to help her up. He fell too.</p><p>Other Marines on the court in the maintenance bay staggered. The ship shivered. The deck heaved. There was a sound like rocks crushing. The ship&#x2019;s energy shell buzzed.</p><p>Whatever <i>Merrimack</i> allowed you to feel wasn&#x2019;t anything close to whatever really hit her. The real sounds were muted way down to something that wouldn&#x2019;t blast your eardrums out.</p><p>The tremor in the deck was just the smallest suggestion of what had actually hit the space battleship.</p><p>The tremor suggested that <i>Merrimack</i> had just been nuked.</p><p>Right now the ship&#x2019;s auto-defense program would be turning the <i>Mack</i> on her central axis faster than your brain synapses could fire, shifting her attitude and raising full shields to cover the engine vents.</p><p>Over the loud com the Dingo&#x2019;s voice sounded: &#x201c;All hands. Siege stations.&#x201d;</p><p>Siege status locked the ship up until the command staff could find out exactly what they were dealing with.<br><br>* * *</p><p>Everyone hated sieges. No one&#x2014;not the navvies, not the Fleet Marines, not the ship&#x2019;s dogs&#x2014;no one liked a defensive fight. You just wanted to get out there and blow something up. Nothing flew under siege. The Marine Wing&#x2019;s fighter craft were locked down in the hangar bay. Nothing to do but stampede with the rest of the team to the projectile gun blisters and wait for something to open up.</p><p>Up ahead of Shasher Wyatt, Kerry Blue was racing Dak Shepard to get to the hatchway of gun bay twenty-five first. She was going to lose that race. Dak used to be a linebacker. But instead of squashing her at the hatchway, Dak grabbed her, shoulders and ass, and launched her into the gun blister ahead of him.</p><p>Shasher was last man in. Climbed onto his gun.</p><p>Of course the foxtrotting gun ports were buttoned shut. That meant the torpedo tubes would also be shut and the missiles clamped down inside the ship&#x2019;s inertial shell.</p><p>The only guns operable at the moment would be the battleship&#x2019;s energy weapons. Those were for the Navy shooters. The Fleet Marines with their projectile weapons had no trade. Got to stare at the blast covers. The monitors didn&#x2019;t show nothin&#x2019;. Had to wonder if they were broken.</p><p>So here was Team Alpha, twiddling their thumbs.</p><p>None of them twiddled well.</p></p><h2>New Found Land: Lewis and Clark&#39;s Voyage of Discovery</h2><p><b>Follow Lewis and Clark and their crew on a perilous trek through the<br>uncharted West in this extraordinary debut novel.</b><br><br>I mean to tell you this story the only way I know how. That is to say, I will tell it like a river. It may meander here and there, but in the end it will always find its way to the sea.<br><br>Two hundred years ago, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark launched their wooden boats up the Missouri River in search of the illusory Northwest Passage, a journey that would capture the American imagination and help forge a young nation's identity. Now, in a riveting debut novel, Allan Wolf tells the story of this extraordinary voyage through the eyes of not only the famed pair but also several members of their self-named Corps of Discovery. Here, in powerful, lyrical language, is a medley of voices from a surprisingly diverse crew &#x2014; from the one-eyed French Indian fiddler who pilots the boats to Clark's African American slave; from the young Shoshone woman who has a baby en route to Lewis's Newfoundland dog, a "seer" whose narrative resonates long after the book is closed.</p><p>Allan Wolf is a member of the national touring company Poetry Alive!, and is able to recite hundreds of poems from memory. Perhaps it is unsurprising, then, that he chose to write this novel in poetic form. As he says, &#34;During the four years it took to research and write NEW FOUND LAND, my head was constantly crowded with the novel&#39;s fourteen voices. They talked to me as I made breakfast, as I dressed the baby, as I delivered newspapers, and as I brushed my teeth. They talked and talked. Alone in my car I began to talk back. And together all fifteen of us worked out the details of the story. Happily, my head is now quiet, the voices having moved to their permanent home within this book.&#34; NEW FOUND LAND is Allan Wolf&#39;s first novel.SACAGAWEA <br><br>THE BIRD WOMAN<br>After my eleventh winter<br><br>I was kidnapped by our enemies<br><br>and made to be their slave.<br>My people, the Shoshone, were in hiding<br><br>in the Shining Mountains <br><br>at the place where three rivers become one.<br><br>In times of war, we never left the camp unescorted.<br><br>That day the young brave Split Feather<br><br>watched over my cousin and me.<br><br>Split Feather kept lookout from atop his horse<br><br>while we two girls crouched by a creek<br><br>mashing pah-see-goo roots with a heavy stone.<br>We were filled with hope.

This acknowledged classic contains 365 daily readings that take heady doctrine and make it practical, realistic, and intensely personal. With humor and humility, Chambers speaks plainly to the common man struggling with devotion to Christ in daily living. Worldly cares and self-serving desires begin to lose their appeal as Chambers aides the reader in transforming his mind by viewing life through the instruction of God's Word. Richard Halverson, former chaplain of the United States Senate, attests to this: "no book except the Bible has influenced my walk with Christ at such deep maturing levels." This is Chambers's chief desire, directing the reader to "shut out every other consideration and keep yourself before God for this one thing only--My Utmost for His Highest... determined to be absolutely and entirely for Him and for Him alone." <i>--Jill Heatherly</i><p>It&#x2019;s one of the best-loved devotionals of all time. . .and now it&#x2019;s back in Barbour&#x2019;s special promotional edition!

When Bruno returns home from school one day, he discovers that his belongings are being packed in crates. His father has received a promotion and the family must move from their home to a new house far far away, where there is no one to play with and nothing to do. A tall fence running alongside stretches as far as the eye can see and cuts him off from the strange people he can see in the distance. But, Bruno longs to be an explorer and decides that there must be more to this desolate new place than what meets the eye. While exploring his new environment, he meets another boy whose life and circumstances are very different to his own, and their meeting results in a friendship that has devastating consequences.</p><p>THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PYJAMAS is John Boyne&#39;s first book for children. He is 33 years old, lives in Dublin and is a full-time writer. He was writer-in-residence at the University of East Anglia on the MA in Creative Writing course and spent many years working as a bookseller.Chapter One <br>Bruno Makes a Discovery <br>One afternoon, when Bruno came home from school, he was surprised to find Maria, the family&#x2019;s maid &#x2014; who always kept her head bowed and never looked up from the carpet &#x2014; standing in his bedroom, pulling all his belongings out of the wardrobe and packing them in four large wooden crates, even the things he&#x2019;d hidden at the back that belonged to him and were nobody else&#x2019;s business. <br><br>&#x2018;What are you doing?&#x2019; he asked in as polite a tone as he could muster, for although he wasn&#x2019;t happy to come home and find someone going through his possessions, his mother had always told him that he was to treat Maria respectfully and not just imitate the way Father spoke to her. &#x2018;You take your hands off my things.&#x2019; <br><br>Maria shook her head and pointed towards the staircase behind him, where Bruno&#x2019;s mother had just appeared. She was a tall woman with long red hair that she bundled into a sort of net behind her head, and she was twisting her hands together nervously as if there was something she didn&#x2019;t want to have to say or something she didn&#x2019;t want to have to believe. <br><br>&#x2018;Mother,&#x2019; said Bruno, marching towards her, &#x2018;what&#x2019;s going on? Why is Maria going through my things?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;She&#x2019;s packing them,&#x2019; explained Mother. <br><br>&#x2018;Packing them?&#x2019; he asked, running quickly through the events of the previous few days to consider whether he&#x2019;d been particularly naughty or had used those words out loud that he wasn&#x2019;t allowed to use and was being sent away because of it. He couldn&#x2019;t think of anything though. In fact over the last few days he had behaved in a perfectly decent manner to everyone and couldn&#x2019;t remember causing any chaos at all. &#x2018;Why?&#x2019; he asked then. &#x2018;What have I done?&#x2019; <br><br>Mother had walked into her own bedroom by then but Lars, the butler, was in there, packing her things too. She sighed and threw her hands in the air in frustration before march-ing back to the staircase, followed by Bruno, who wasn&#x2019;t going to let the matter drop without an explanation. <br><br>&#x2018;Mother,&#x2019; he insisted. &#x2018;What&#x2019;s going on? Are we moving?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Come downstairs with me,&#x2019; said Mother, leading the way towards the large dining room where the Fury had been to dinner the week before. &#x2018;We&#x2019;ll talk down there.&#x2019; <br><br>Bruno ran downstairs and even passed her out on the staircase so that he was waiting in the dining room when she arrived. He looked at her without saying anything for a moment and thought to himself that she couldn&#x2019;t have applied her make-up correctly that morning because the rims of her eyes were more red than usual, like his own after he&#x2019;d been causing chaos and got into trouble and ended up crying. <br><br>&#x2018;Now, you don&#x2019;t have to worry, Bruno,&#x2019; said Mother, sitting down in the chair where the beautiful blonde woman who had come to dinner with the Fury had sat and waved at him when Father closed the doors. &#x2018;In fact if anything it&#x2019;s going to be a great adventure.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;What is?&#x2019; he asked. &#x2018;Am I being sent away?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;No, not just you,&#x2019; she said, looking as if she might smile for a moment but thinking better of it. &#x2018;We all are. Your father and I, Gretel and you. All four of us.&#x2019; <br><br>Bruno thought about this and frowned. He wasn&#x2019;t particularly bothered if Gretel was being sent away because she was a Hopeless Case and caused nothing but trouble for him. But it seemed a little unfair that they all had to go with her. <br><br>&#x2018;But where?&#x2019; he asked. &#x2018;Where are we going exactly? Why can&#x2019;t we stay here?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Your father&#x2019;s job,&#x2019; explained Mother. &#x2018;You know how important it is, don&#x2019;t you?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Yes, of course,&#x2019; said Bruno, nodding his head, because there were always so many visitors to the house &#x2014; men in fantastic uniforms, women with typewriters that he had to keep his mucky hands off &#x2014; and they were always very polite to Father and told each other that he was a man to watch and that the Fury had big things in mind for him. <br><br>&#x2018;Well, sometimes when someone is very important,&#x2019; continued Mother, &#x2018;the man who employs him asks him to go somewhere else because there&#x2019;s a very special job that needs doing there.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;What kind of job?&#x2019; asked Bruno, because if he was honest with himself &#x2014; which he always tried to be &#x2014; he wasn&#x2019;t entirely sure what job Father did. <br><br>In school they had talked about their fathers one day and Karl had said that his father was a greengrocer, which Bruno knew to be true because he ran the greengrocer&#x2019;s shop in the centre of town. And Daniel had said that his father was a teacher, which Bruno knew to be true because he taught the big boys who it was always wise to steer clear of. And Martin had said that his father was a chef, which Bruno knew to be true because he sometimes collected Martin from school and when he did he always wore a white smock and a tartan apron, as if he&#x2019;d just stepped out of his kitchen. <br><br>But when they asked Bruno what his father did he opened his mouth to tell them, then realized that he didn&#x2019;t know himself. All he could say was that his father was a man to watch and that the Fury had big things in mind for him. Oh, and that he had a fantastic uniform too. <br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s a very important job,&#x2019; said Mother, hesitating for a moment. &#x2018;A job that needs a very special man to do it. You can understand that, can&#x2019;t you?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;And we all have to go too?&#x2019; asked Bruno. <br><br>&#x2018;Of course we do,&#x2019; said Mother. &#x2018;You wouldn&#x2019;t want Father to go to his new job on his own and be lonely there, would you?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;I suppose not,&#x2019; said Bruno. <br><br>&#x2018;Father would miss us all terribly if we weren&#x2019;t with him,&#x2019; she added. <br><br>&#x2018;Who would he miss the most?&#x2019; asked Bruno. &#x2018;Me or Gretel?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;He would miss you both equally,&#x2019; said Mother, for she was a great believer in not play-ing favourites, which Bruno respected, especially since he knew that he was her favourite really. <br><br>&#x2018;But what about our house?&#x2019; asked Bruno. &#x2018;Who&#x2019;s going to take care of it while we&#x2019;re gone?&#x2019; <br><br>Mother sighed and looked around the room as if she might never see it again. It was a very beautiful house and had five floors in total, if you included the basement, where Cook made all the food and Maria and Lars sat at the table argu-ing with each other and calling each other names that you weren&#x2019;t supposed to use. And if you added in the little room at the top of the house with the slanted windows where Bruno could see right across Berlin if he stood up on his tiptoes and held on to the frame tightly. <br><br>&#x2018;We have to close up the house for now,&#x2019; said Mother. &#x2018;But we&#x2019;ll come back to it someday.&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;And what about Cook?&#x2019; asked Bruno. &#x2018;And Lars? And Maria? Are they not going to live in it?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;They&#x2019;re coming with us,&#x2019; explained Mother. &#x2018;But that&#x2019;s enough questions for now. Maybe you should go upstairs and help Maria with your packing.&#x2019; <br><br>Bruno stood up from the seat but didn&#x2019;t go anywhere. There were just a few more questions he needed to put to her before he could allow the matter to be settled. <br><br>&#x2018;And how far away is it?&#x2019; he asked. &#x2018;The new job, I mean. Is it further than a mile away?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Oh my,&#x2019; said Mother with a laugh, although it was a strange kind of laugh because she didn&#x2019;t look happy and turned away from Bruno as if she didn&#x2019;t want him to see her face. &#x2018;Yes, Bruno,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s more than a mile away. Quite a lot more than that, in fact.&#x2019; <br><br>Bruno&#x2019;s eyes opened wide and his mouth made the shape of an O. He felt his arms stretching out at his sides like they did whenever something surprised him. &#x2018;You don&#x2019;t mean we&#x2019;re leaving Berlin?&#x2019; he asked, gasping for air as he got the words out. <br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m afraid so,&#x2019; said Mother, nodding her head sadly. &#x2018;Your father&#x2019;s job is&#x2013;&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;But what about school?&#x2019; said Bruno, inter-rupting her, a thing he knew he was not supposed to do but which he felt he would be forgiven for on this occasion. &#x2018;And what about Karl and Daniel and Martin? How will they know where I am when we want to do things together?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;You&#x2019;ll have to say goodbye to your friends for the time being,&#x2019; said Mother. &#x2018;Although I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll see them again in time. And don&#x2019;t interrupt your mother when she&#x2019;s talking, please,&#x2019; she added, for although this was strange and unpleasant news, there was certainly no need for Bruno to break the rules of politeness which he had been taught. <br><br>&#x2018;Say goodbye to them?&#x2019; he asked, staring at her in surprise. &#x2018;Say goodbye to them?&#x2019; he repeated, spluttering out the words as if his mouth was full of biscuits that he&#x2019;d munched into tiny pieces but not actually swallowed yet. &#x2018;Say goodbye to Karl and Daniel and Martin?&#x2019; he continued, his voice coming dangerously close to shouting, which was not allowed indoors. &#x2018;But they&#x2019;re my three best friends for life!&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Oh, you&#x2019;ll make other friends,&#x2019; said Mother, waving her hand in the air dismissively, as if the making of a boy&#x2019;s three best friends for life was an easy thing. <br><br>&#x2018;But we had plans,&#x2019; he protested. <br><br>&#x2018;Plans?&#x2019; asked Mother, raising an eyebrow. &#x2018;What sort of plans?&#x2019; <br><br>&#x2018;Wel...</p><h2>The dissertation: A novel</h2><p>To fulfill his Ph.D. requirement at an American university, Camilo Fuertes decides to write about his father, Leon Fuertes, the martyred president of Tinieblas.

In the inflated debates that have ensued, it is precisely history which has been ignored, for the conception of <i>posthistoire</i> is far from new. Here, Lutz Niethammer, Germany&#x2019;s leading practitioner of &#x2018;history from below&#x2019;, explores in fascinating detail the forms the conception has taken in the twentieth century and assembles what amounts to an intellectual history of disillusion and resignation. In his survey of thinkers as diverse as Kojeve, Heidegger and Junger, he finds adherents to the idea of the end of history on the Right and Left. But whether they pinned all their hopes on the nation or the proletariat, in different ways they have all conflated the apparent collapse of a particular historical project with the collapse of history itself.</p><p>A translator from Romanian, Spanish, German, French, and Italian, <b>Patrick Camiller</b> has translated many works, including Dumitru Tsepeneag&#x2019;s <i>Vain Art of the Fugue</i>, <i>The Necessary Marriage</i>, and <i>Hotel Europa</i>.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Let&#39;s Find It!</h2><p>A hide-and-seek game book presents pictures of such varied environments as a forest, a street, a spring garden, the beach, and a pond with labels to identify different plants and animals.</p><p>Katya Arnold decided to become an artist, inspired by the examples of her grandmother, an artist and costume maker, and her great-uncle, a children&#39;s book author.

Part picture book, part nature guide, and part game, this brightly illustrated volume offers a pleasant, highly visual introduction to the natural world. Each spread includes two complementary pages. On the left, Arnold presents small paintings of many individual plants and animals, each labeled and clearly delineated against the white background. On the right, a full-page painting depicts a habitat that includes every species shown on the left. The game is to find and identify all the animals and plants in the crowded pictures. Other than the labels, the pages are wordless. Each right-hand illustration includes the same dog and cat, and sometimes a girl and a boy, adding continuity. More concrete information is given in the closing pages, including labeled diagrams showing the anatomical parts of certain fungi, flowers, insects, mollusks, birds, mammals, etc. The colorful paintings express both joy in the profusion of nature and in the observation of detail. Though children may need help in using the book, an enthusiastic reader could make it a playful experience for a child, fostering both visual discrimination skills and an interest in nature. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Naturally, she takes their daughters and son with her. The children, however, only make it as far as the train station--and even after returning home remain unaffected by their brief exile. "They ought either to be quieter or more noisy than before," their father thinks, "and it was disconcerting that they seemed to be exactly the same." Frank's routines, however, drift into disorder as he tries desperately to take charge of life at home and work. Even his printing plant is suddenly confronted by the specters of modernization and utter instability. <p> In Penelope Fitzgerald's fiction, affection and remorse are all too often allied, and desire and design seem never to meet. Frank wants little more than a quiet, confident life--something for which he is deeply unsuited, and which Russia certainly will not go out of her way to provide. <i>The Beginning of Spring</i> is filled with echoes of past wrongs and whispers of the revolution to come, even if the author evokes these with abrupt comic brio. (In one disturbance, "A great many shots had hit people for whom they were not intended.") As ever, Fitzgerald makes us care for--and want to know ever more about--her characters, even the minor players. Her two-page description of Frank's chief type compositor, for instance, is a miracle of precision and humor, sympathy and mystery. And the accountant Selwyn Crane--a Tolstoy devot�e, self-published poet, and expert at making others feel guilty--is a sublime creation. His appetite for do-gooding is insatiable. After one fit of apparent altriusm, "Selwyn subsided. Now that he saw everything was going well, his mind was turning to his next charitable enterprise. With the terrible aimlessness of the benevolent, he was casting round for a new misfortune." As she evokes her household of tears and laughter, Fitzgerald's prose is as witty as ever, rendering the past present and the modern timeless. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>Mariner paperback, 1998, previous ISBN 978-0-395-90871-6</p><h2>Heavenly Bodies: Film Stars and Society</h2><p><p>Richard Dyer's classic study of movie stars and stardom has been updated, with a new introduction by the author discussing the rise of celebrity culture and developments in the study of stars since publication of the first edition in 1986. <br><br>Dyer's illuminating study is based around case studies of three major stars: Marilyn Monroe, Paul Robeson and Judy Garland.

Originally published under the title <i>The Spectator</i>, this knowledgeable and perceptive&#x201d; (<i>Library Journal</i>) look at show business presents the actors directors, playwrights, dancers, lyricists, and others who created the dramatic works of the twentieth century.</p><p>Among the many highlights in these pages, Buster Keaton explains the wonders of unscripted silent comedy, Federico Fellini reflects on honesty in art, Carol Channing reveals that she is far more serious than she lets on, and Marlon Brando turns the tables and wants to interview Terkel. We learn about crucial artistic decisions in the lives of Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, and Edward Albee and hear from a range of film directors, from Vittorio De Sica and King Vidor to Satyajit Ray. We even get to witness Terkel playing straight man to a wildly inventive Zero Mostel. Because Terkel knows his subjects&#x2019; work intimately, he asks precisely the right questions to elicit the most revealing responses. As the <i>New York Times Book Review </i> noted, Terkel&#x2019;s knowledge and force of personality make him fully a player alongside his famous guests.&#x201d;</p><br></p><p>In earlier oral histories such as <i>Working</i>, <i>The Good War</i>, and <i>Hard Times</i>, Studs Terkel showed a virtuoso talent for absorbing the small talk of regular Joes and Janes and turning it into a literary cross-hatch--Robert Browning and Herodotus, Margaret Mead and Steinbeck. It turns out all this was prologue. In <i>The Spectator</i>, Terkel reveals that if he loved the waitresses and hockey players of earlier books, it wasn't in "the way, nor to the same degree, as those in the world of the lively arts." You can tell, reading this book. The Terkel touch is all here, but in 50-plus interviews with the likes of Buster Keaton and Marlon Brando, James Cagney, Simone Signoret, Jacques Tati, and (weirdly) Arnold Schwarzenegger, it's Studs's range that astonishes. He has textured memories of remote stage productions of Arthur Miller's plays--which you might expect. But when he remembers <i>Kanchenjungha</i> with the Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray, Ray laughs out loud: "Where did you see that?" There are lovely little fender benders, too: in a basement apartment in Paris in 1963, Simone Signoret extravagantly praises Fran�oise Rosay and Agnes de Mille, characters we know from earlier chapters--de Mille especially. A choreographer who brought ballet to Broadway musicals, she explains that African rhythms and English clog dancing married to beget tap; with a shift from up to down beat, she says, "syncopation and jazz were born." Reading <i>The Spectator</i>, you marvel once again at Terkel's facility with people of all kinds--and his deep familiarity with the American century. <i>--Lyall Bush</i>Studs Terkel (1912&#x2013;2008) was an award-winning author and radio broadcaster.

Or does the mind protect itself by banishing traumatic memories from consciousness? How victims remember trauma is the most controversial issue in psychology today, spilling out of consulting rooms and laboratories to capture headlines, rupture families, provoke legislative change, and influence criminal trials and civil suits. This book, by a clinician who is also a laboratory researcher, is the first comprehensive, balanced analysis of the clinical and scientific evidence bearing on this issue--and the first to provide definitive answers to the urgent questions at the heart of the controversy. </p><p> Synthesizing clinical case reports and the vast research literature on the effects of stress, suggestion, and trauma on memory, Richard McNally arrives at significant conclusions, first and foremost that traumatic experiences are indeed unforgettable. Though people sometimes do not think about disturbing experiences for long periods of time, traumatic events rarely slip from awareness for very long; furthermore, McNally reminds us, failure to think about traumas--such as early sexual abuse--must not be confused with amnesia or an inability to remember them. In fact, the evidence for repressed memories of trauma--or even for repression at all--is surprisingly weak. </p><p> A magisterial work of scholarship, panoramic in scope and nonpartisan throughout, this unfailingly lucid work will prove indispensable to anyone seeking to understand how people remember trauma. </p></p><p><b>Richard J. McNally</b> is Professor of Psychology at Harvard University.Richard McNally calls this theory of amnesia "psychiatric folklore." As a therapist and a professor of psychology at Harvard, he has spent years studying the effects of trauma on people's mental processes--including memory. He is on top of the research and has done some of it himself. The investigational literature is vast, and <i>Remembering Trauma</i> covers virtually all of it...Elegant and impassioned. [This book] makes a supposedly complex topic simple. Or at least simple enough to make readers wonder about the ready acceptance of a notion that goes against common sense and experience. (Debbie Nathan <i>Washington Post</i> 2003-05-04)<br><br>McNally...is both a clinician who studies anxiety disorders and one of the leading scientific investigators in the field of trauma and memory. <i>Remembering Trauma</i> is an exhaustive review of the scientific research and clinical evidence pertaining to trauma and memory, including what is known about dreams and nightmares, flashbacks, repression, dissociation, amnesia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. (Carol Tavris <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2003-08-15)<br><br>There are those occasional books that restore faith in reason, whose authors have the courage to take on the professional and scientific ideologies of the age. <i>Remembering Trauma</i>, by Richard McNally, is such a book...I recommend this book to all those working in the field of memory and trauma and to lay readers with an interest in the intriguing field of psychological amnesia. McNally has set a standard for application of experimental and observational data to notions and hypotheses about memory and trauma. The book informs the current public and professional debates, clarifies battling ideologies, and avoids the 'political correctness' that has been so damaging to scientific inquiry. The reader, whether lay or professional, will emerge more knowledgeable and more skeptical of many scientific and clinical assertions about memory and particularly amnesia. (Glenn Craig Davis <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> 2003-12-10)<br><br>[McNally] addresses all of the relevant data, including those studies heralded as definitive by proponents of repressed memory. Meticulously analyzing the morass of findings, he makes sense of the rampant contradictions...McNally's synthesis of research from clinical psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychology provides the most comprehensive and even-handed work on this important topic. (Stephen J. Ceci <i>Science</i> 2003-07-25)<br><br>Every now and then a book appears that can be instantly recognized as essential for its field--a work that must become standard reading if that field is to be purged of needless confusion and fortified against future errors of the same general kind.

(Frederick Crews <i>New York Review of Books</i> 2004-03-11)<br><br>'How victims remember trauma is the most divisive issue facing psychology today,' according to Richard J.

(Richard Restak <i>Washington Times</i> 2003-04-20)<br><br>The mechanisms by which therapists, police interrogators and others can lead people to believe that they remember events that did not occur are carefully described by McNally...Anyone interested in understanding how trauma is remembered must read this book. And anyone who has been poisoned by 'recovered memories,' as victim or accused, will find it a powerful antidote. (David Canter <i>New Scientist</i> 2003-06-14)<br><br><i>Remembering Trauma</i> is a powerful counterweight to a literature that has often ranged from sloppy to ill-informed to overwrought, and to a field that is too often susceptible to the promptings of politics and culture. McNally has produced a work of exemplary scholarship that should begin to free our conceptions of trauma from the grip of many contemporary illusions. If it accomplishes this, it will be a grand achievement far beyond its field. (Sally Satel <i>New Republic</i> 2003-05-19)<br><br>The importance of Richard J. McNally's new book <i>Remembering Trauma</i> lies not just in the superb and definitive survey McNally makes of the history of repressed memories, but also in what the book stands for: <i>Remembering Trauma</i> is the monument built to mark the end of the memory wars...[It] is more than the final nail in the coffin of the repressed-memory craze. It is the blueprint for how psychiatry can best progress in the years to come. (Paul R. McHugh <i>Weekly Standard</i> 2003-05-26)<br><br>McNally summarizes the science of trauma and memory and considers whether therapists can implant 'false memory.' McNally suggests that U.S. culture's position concerning all forms of abuse is characterized by hysteria, and he points out that data reveal that traumatic information is memorable and that most people remember it well. Though an individual may be unwilling to reveal a traumatic event, he argues, that should not be mistaken for repressed memory...Clinical psychologists should read McNally's book for its data summaries and discussions of applied problems, including forensics. This book is a must for therapists working with trauma victims, and it will be a valuable resource for therapists who wish to avoid unethically or naively 'implanting' false memory in their clients.

Reprint.</p><p>Wolfe continues the saga begun in Nightside the Long Sun with this curious mix of science and medieval culture in which gods possess people and robotic police patrol mysterious underground passageways. Patera Silk, a young cleric, attempts to ransom his parish buildings from creditors; in the process he uncovers a larger conspiracy involving the government of Viron and even the gods he worships. Emerging from the underground with his new knowledge, he finds himself chosen as leader ("Calde") of the masses and is simultaneously arrested. As a hero, Silk is good-natured but he lacks the energy and complexity required by his role. He often seems slighty lost, a lack of direction mirrored by the slowly developing narrative, which picks up only shortly before the finish. While the language is often inventive ("deadcoach" for horse-drawn hearse), it proves equally distracting; nor are the secondary characters distinctly depicted. Reference is made to the next volume of Wolfe's projected tetralogy, increasing the sense that this book is little more than a bridge between more important segments. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.The second volume in Wolfe's inspired new tetralogy, <i>The Book of the Long Sun</i>, continues looking like an sf masterwork in the making. Returning to the expansive, cityscaped interior of the Whorl, a massive space-faring vehicle whose origins are shrouded in legend, Wolfe resumes the story of Patera Silk, a cleric from a poor parish who turns thief to buy back his church from the wealthy crime lord, Blood. Silk plots to extort the required sum from Blood's hired physician, Dr. Crane, who, Silk discovers, is spying behind his employer's back. Following Crane's trail, Silk quickly finds himself entangled in the stratagems of operators shadier than himself and unwittingly stumbles on deeper secrets behind and below the Whorl. Wolfe excels at his own brand of richly textured mythmaking, embracing elements of magic without veering into fantasy. What emerges is a captivating narrative involving pious cyborgs, corrupt holy men, and mysterious high-altitude flyers, with subterranean tunnels, archaic technology, and televised messages from gods. Volumes three and four are avidly awaited. <i>Carl Hays</i></p><h2>The Art of Rigging (A Definitive Guide to Character Technical Direction with Alias Maya, Volume 1)</h2><p>The Art of Rigging, volume one, is a beautiful text printed at the highest quality in full color.

Born in Atlanta in 1934, he has taught widely throughout the United States. A prolific writer and scholar, Wills is the author of more than twenty books, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>Lincoln at Gettysburg, Papal Sin</i>, and <i>What Jesus Meant</i>. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.Explicating his theory that religion is an inextricable element of American political life, Wills sheds new light on the 1988 presidential campaign. While George Bush wooed Jerry Falwell and extolled patriotism, religion, law and order, Jesse Jackson and Pat Robertson--both ordained ministers, both from the South, both advocates of a moral revival--represented antipodal political extremes. The "secularity" of Michael Dukakis's campaign came across in his "pinched ideal of politics," while Gary Hart, a product of Yale Divinity School, failed to find "a new moral language" to account for personal indiscretions. Wills ( Reagan's America ) writes incisively of Mario Cuomo's stand on abortion and of Robert Bork, "a friend of censorship." He gives his central thesis historical ballast; for example, Abraham Lincoln saw the Civil War as an act of "expiatory suffering," and deist Thomas Jefferson in his private writings revealed his enthusiasm for Jesus's ethical doctrines.

The years since then have brought so many changes that the girl I was in Los Angeles seems like another person. But my memory, bio-enhanced now, remains vivid. <br>I felt the city that night. Although LA never fully slept, it was quiet, wrapped in its own thoughts. Drowsing. Waiting for a jolt to wake it up. <br>Joshua met me when I finished my shift at the restaurant, and we walked to the bus stop. It had drizzled earlier and a slick film covered the street, reflecting the lights in blurred smears of oily water. Above us a few stars managed to outshine the city lights and pollution, valiant in their efforts to outdo the faint amber glow that tinted the darkened sky. Sparse late-night traffic flowed by, sleek animals gliding through the night, intent on their own purposes. <br>I could see Joshua's good mood. It spread out from him in a rose-colored mist that shifted with vague shapes, the form of unspoken words. It sounded like waves on a beach, smelled like seaweed, tasted like salt. I was used to seeing and hearing people's emotions, even feeling them on my skin, but smells and tastes came less often. I knew nothing about Coulomb forces then, but it didn't matter: experience had taught me the effect decreased with distance; I would experience it until he moved away. Or until the intensity of his mood faded. I didn't tell him, of course. I didn't want to sound crazy. <br>We sat at the bus stop and Joshua put his arm around my shoulders, not like a boyfriend, which he had never been to me, but like the best friend I had known for six years, since 1981, the year Jamaica became the fifty-first state and the Hollywood sign burned down in the hills above LA. Tousled curls fell over his forehead and brushed the wire rims of his glasses. He was my opposite in many ways, his blond curls sun-bright compared to my waist-length black hair. His eyes had always seemed like bits of sky to me, blue and clear where mine were black. <br>A harsh sensation punctured the bubble of our mood. I had no idea where it came from, only that it cut like a knife. <br>"Tina, look." Joshua pointed across the street. <br>I looked. A red sports car was turning off San Carlos Boulevard into a side street. "What about it?" <br>"That was Nug driving." <br>Hearing Nug's name was like being hit by ice water. "He can drive down the street if he wants." <br>"He was watching us." Joshua looked past my shoulder and his face relaxed. "The bus is coming." <br>As we stood, the bus came alongside us. I got on and glanced back at Joshua. He waved, his hand disappearing from sight as the driver closed the door. <br>During the ride I sat by myself, leaning against the window. The few other passengers seemed lost in their own thoughts. I wondered if they were going home to their families, to a world they understood. <br>As hard as I tried to fit, Los Angeles was alien to me. I had grown up in the Zinacanteco village of Nabenchauk on the Chiapas plateau in southern Mexico. I missed its cool evergreen forests, its dry winters and rainy summers. My earliest memories were of my mother, kneeling barefoot at her <i>metate</i>, grinding maize in the predawn hours. In many ways, she was a traditional Maya woman. So how, at fourteen, did she get pregnant with me by an artist from Mexico City who visited Nabenchauk to paint the village? <br>When I was eight, my uncle and aunt died in one of the earthquakes that hit the highlands, leaving behind their eleven-year-old son Manuel. After years of struggling with the decision, my mother decided to look for my father. She took Manuel and me down the Pan American Highway to Mexico City, what I thought then was the edge of the universe. We never did find him. Eventually we ended up here, in the city of sleepless, fallen angels. <br>The bus stopped on San Carlos Boulevard a few blocks from where I lived. The drugstore on the corner was closed and deserted. I had hoped Los Halcones would be around so I could ask someone to walk me home. My cousin Manuel had died the previous year, just before my seventeenth birthday, and since then Los Halcones had looked out for me. I could almost see Mario jiving with my cousin: <i>Oye, vato, let's go the show</i>. And Manuel: <i>Chale homes. I want to go cruising and check out some firme rucas</i>. No one was there that night, though. <br>The Stop-And-Go down the block was still open. I could call Mario. But I would have to wake him up, and I knew he had been getting up early, trying to find a job. The last thing he needed was for me to drag him out of bed at one in the morning. <br>It was only a few blocks to where I lived. I knew the neighborhood well and most everyone knew me. So it was that I made the decision that changed my life. Maybe I knew, on a level below conscious thought, that something was different that night. Perhaps a neuroscientist could have mapped out the neural processes that prodded my decision, or a physicist could have calculated the changes in the electromagnetic fields produced by my brain. Whatever the reason, I decided to walk home. <br>I headed down a side street. Old buildings lined the road, tenements and weathered houses. Although most of the street lamps were dark, a few made pools of light on the sidewalk. Cracks in the concrete jagged everywhere, overgrown with grass. Debris lay scattered: chunks of rock, plaster, newspapers, candy wrappings, empty cigarette boxes, fast-food trash blowing along the street or caught up against a building. Somewhere curtains thwapped in the breeze. The smell of damp paper tickled my nose. <br>When my mother first brought us to LA, we lived in one of its more meager outlying areas. Although we didn't have much in terms of material goods, she gave us a stable home and more than enough love. After her death, Manuel and I moved here, where we could better afford the rent. <br>As I walked home, I became aware of an odd sensation. A trickle. It ran over my arms like the runoff from a torrent of warm air rushing by in a nearby <i>caon</i>. But the canyon was in my mind, not in the city. <br>Two blocks later I saw him. <br>He stood about a block away, facing the road, a tall man with curly hair. I didn't recognize him. The one working lamp on that stretch of the road was only a few feet behind where I stood, so as soon as he turned he would see me. I knew I should leave, but what he was doing was so odd, I hesitated, stopping to watch. <br>He held a box that hummed and glittered with color: red, gold, blue, green, purple, silver. Holding it in front of his body, he turned in a circle, his attention fixed on it. From the way he dressed, I would have expected him to be robbing stores instead of playing with gadgets. But then, when Manuel ran with Los Halcones, he dressed that way: sleeveless vest and pants tucked into his boots. This man's clothes were black, though; Manuel had preferred T-shirts and faded jeans. <br>Thinking about Manuel brought me back to my senses. I backed away, intending to be gone before this guy saw me. But it was too late. He stopped turning and looked up. At first he just stood there, staring. Then he started toward me, his long legs devouring the space that separated us. <br>That's it, I thought. I spun around and ran. <br>" <i>Esp�rate</i>," he called. " <i>Habla conmigo</i>." <br>I wasn't sure why his terrible Spanish made me turn back. I could barely understand him. His voice was strange, too. On <i>habla</i> it rumbled with a deep note, like a low tone on a piano. But the warmth I had felt was stronger, flowing over my skin, a river now instead of a trickle. <br>He had stopped again and was watching me. I watched back, ready to run if he came closer. <br>He tried again. " <i>Preguntar mi tu decir</i>." <br>His grammar made no sense. "� <i>Qu�</i>?" <br>" <i>Despierto mi</i>." He paused. " <i>Yo espaol mal</i>." <br> <i>He Spanish bad</i>? That was an understatement. "How about English?" <br>"Yes." Relief flickered across his face. "Much better." His English was accented, but easier to understand. Every other sentence or so, his voice made that odd sound, like a musical note. They ranged through about an octave, one down low on a piano keyboard. <br>"What do you want?" I asked. <br>He held out his palms as if to show he had no weapons. It wasn't reassuring. He could have a knife or a gun hidden anywhere. And he still had the box in his hand. <br>"Lost," he said. "Help can find you me?" <br>"What?" <br>He paused, his face blanking like a cleared computer screen. Then he said, "Can you help me? I'm lost." <br>"Where were you going?" <br>"Washington, originally." <br>I tensed. Nug and his men hung around Washington's liquor store. They all wore black, and wrist guards too, like this guy. I backed up a step. "You're a long way from Washington's." <br>"Yes." He paused. "I decided not to come down in a continental capital." <br>Did he mean Washington, D.C.? I wondered if he was on anything. He didn't sound like it, though; his words weren't slurred or wandering, he just didn't speak English that well. <br>"What's in Washington?" I asked. <br>"A reception." <br>I almost laughed. "You're going to a party there dressed like that?" <br>"This is my duty uniform. My dress uniform is on the ship." <br>I wondered if he realized how strange he sounded. I hadn't heard of anyone like him in the neighborhood. "What's your name?" <br>"Althor." <br>It sounded like a nickname. All of Nug's men took one, though most of them were less creative about it. "You mean Thor? The guy with the hammer?" <br>"I'm sorry, but I don't know to whom you refer," <br> <i>Whom</i>? I didn't know people existed who actually used that word. Despite my wariness, I was growing more and more intrigued. I motioned at his box. "What is that?" <br>"Transcom," he said. <br>"What does it do?" <br>"Transmits and receives waves. Right now I scan radio signals." He came closer, showing me the box, and I backed away. As I stepped into the halo from the street lamp, he stopped and stared as if he had just seen me. In a sense he had, since I had only then moved into the light. <br>"Gods," he said. "You're beautiful." <br>I kept backing toward the drugstore. <br>"Don't go." Althor started toward me again. <br>As soon as he moved in my direction, I took off running. <br>"Wait," he called. <br>I stopped. Turned. Looked at him. Why? Something about him was familiar, but for the life of me, I couldn't place it. I felt it too, like tendrils of mist coming off a river. A sense of warmth. Affection, almost. So I hesitated, ready to run but waiting to see what he would do. <br>Althor backed up to the street lamp so I could see him better. He was tall, about six-foot-four. His eyes were dark, black it looked like, though it was hard to see in the dim light. He had fair skin and curly hair that, as far as I could tell, was the same color as the bronze bracelet my mother gave me before she died. I had to admit he was nice looking. Strange, but handsome. Just because he was handsome, though, didn't mean he was all right. <br>"You run with Nug?" I asked. <br>"Who?" <br>"Nug. You know." <br>"I do not know." <br>"You must've seen him around. Tall guy. Anglo. Blue eyes. Buzz hair." <br>"I don't know this man." He considered me. "You don't recognize my uniform, do you?" <br>"I've never seen no uniform like that." I winced. "Any uniform." Even now, when I speak seven languages, I sometimes forget to avoid the double negative in English. It seems a strange language, not allowing you an extra negative to make a point. <br>"I am ****" he said. <br>"What?" <br>He said the word again and it still sounded like gibberish. <br>"I don't understand," I said. <br>"Literally I think it translates as 'Jagernaut Secondary.'" <br>"Jagernaut?" <br>He nodded. "Secondary is similar to what you call a naval captain." He paused. "Actually, it comes closer to your air force. Major, maybe." <br>"You're a soldier?" <br>"Pilot. ISC Tactical Fighter Wing." <br>A pilot! Wariness followed my initial excitement. He didn't look like a fighter pilot. "What's ISC?" <br>"Imp--" He hesitated. "Space Command." <br>At the time, I was sure he was a nut case or stoned, or else that he thought I was stupid enough to believe him. "Yeah, sure." <br>"Why do you think I make this up?" <br>"Well, I don't run into many fighter pilots on my way home." <br>Althor smiled. "I guess not." <br>His smile caught me by surprise. No cruelty showed in it, nor was it a false smile, or the too easy smile of someone who never had reason to cry. It had history to it, complicated history. <br>I relaxed a bit. "So how come you're in LA?" <br>He considered me, as if trying to decide whether or not I was a threat. It was funny, really. Five-foot-two me in a fluffy miniskirt threatening six-foot-four him. When he finally answered, I figured that same thought had occurred to him. I had no idea then of the true reason he chose to trust me, nor of the extensive calculations that went into his decision. <br>"I'm in the wrong place," he said. "Actually, it looks like the wrong time. According to positions of the stars, the date is exactly as I expected. But everything is different." He pointed to the streetlight. "For one thing, I never knew this, that Los Angeles had such lamps." <br>I blinked. The street lamps were the same as everywhere else in LA: tall antique poles, each ending in a scalloped hook. The glass lamp hanging from the hook was shaped like the bell on an old Spanish mission. Books about California never failed to show them. <br>"They're angel bells," I said. <br>"Angel bells? I have never heard this before." <br>"You really must be new. They're as famous as the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco." <br>Althor frowned. "I've studied American history. If these bells are as famous as you say, I would recognize them." <br>"Maybe your teacher didn't know LA that well." <br>"My 'teacher' was a computer chip. It had no record of these bell-lamps." He looked around at the debris-strewn street, the broken windows in the building closest to us, its crumbling steps. "You live here?" <br>I didn't like him asking where I lived. When I didn't answer, he said, "Why do you live like this?" <br>I gritted my teeth. "Because I do." <br>He jerked, as if my anger had struck him. "My sorry. I meant no offense." <br>After an awkward silence, I said, "So where are you from?" <br>"Originally, Parthonia." <br>"Where?" <br>"Parthonia. The seat of the Skolian government." <br>"Never heard of it." <br>"After everything else I've found here, or not found, I'm not surprised." He sat on the steps of the building next to us and poked at his box. "Everything is wrong. The only transmissions I find are at radio frequencies." <br>I stepped closer to see the box.

Zhuang Liehong was the son of a fisherman, the former owner of a small tea shop, and the spark that had sent his village into an uproar&#x2014;pitting residents against a corrupt local government. Under the alias Patriot Number One, he had stoked a series of pro-democracy protests, hoping to change his home for the better.

In the first, the American embassy would simply send someone to pick him up. He envisioned a midnight escape&#x2014;cars waiting in the shadows along the uneven, trash-filled fields on the outskirts of his village. He felt sure, when he considered the plan, that the Americans would be sympathetic to his situation. He was a lover of democracy trapped in a corrupt corner of Guangdong Province. If the plan were to work, it would have to be secret. His friends would wake the next morning to find him vanished. By the time the news spread, he would be on a plane, heading toward a new life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In a second plan, Zhuang would flee by sea. He had learned that Guam, a mere two thousand miles from the Guangdong coastline, was U.S. territory. This plan made it closer to execution: he went to work on a friend&#x2019;s fishing boat in Wukan Bay in preparation&#x2014;ten grueling hours on a wooden plank boat, fully exposed to the sun&#x2014;and purchased slightly too much fuel each time, stockpiling it slowly, so no one would notice. He planned to buy two motors. &#x201c;Just in case one died,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I would use one some of the time and then switch them. Sometimes I would use them both, and vrrrmm!&#x201d; He would wait until the two months of the year when the intervening stretch of ocean was at its calmest, the swells low and rolling, the water undisturbed by typhoons. Then he would take a tiny boat out into the expanse of the South China Sea. He estimated the trip would take about ten days. He could make it, if he had to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zhuang was a man of Wukan Village, a proud former village leader on the ragged outskirts of Guangdong Province&#x2019;s manufacturing boom. He was on the verge of thirty, stocky and compact, meticulous about his appearance but always slightly out of style. His crooked teeth gave away a childhood spent in poverty, but he was not self-conscious about them. He grinned while greeting people on the street, pouring tea in his tea shop, or singing at the local KTV. He smiled relentlessly in the face of danger or embarrassment. He suffered from the occasional lapse in reading social cues and fought it with volume, warmth, and a strong handshake.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During the summer of 2013, paranoia overtook Zhuang&#x2019;s home village, and he recognized the feeling of trouble on the horizon. The shadowy forces of the county-level government&#x2014;people he had rebelled against a few years before&#x2014;were returning to Wukan. His friends were sure that their phones had been tapped by local security forces, the lackeys of corrupt officials. A propaganda official had taken up residence in a local school. Zhuang took the extra precaution of hiding his cell phone in the back of his tea shop whenever he discussed politics. He had heard rumors that government spies could turn them on remotely and listen in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was a time when Zhuang had run headlong into political turmoil. He had led protests, helped spark at least one riot, and argued with police interrogators over cigarettes. He had seen his friends kidnapped by thugs and his village invaded, and he had mourned a friend who died in police custody. But now Zhuang had a wife and a son. Now he understood the consequences of protest and revolution. He did not want to end up in jail, fearing for his life, worrying about his family. So he made plans and counterplans.</p><p>He schemed while sitting in his tea shop, a storefront business he had opened along the smaller of the two main arteries that ran through his village. He pulled up the storefront barrier and sat behind sliding glass doors, watching the rain hit the metal awnings that shaded the shops, and the sun return to bake the scoured concrete of the lane. Zhuang first opened the shop in late 2012, when it was nice out and the political pressure more remote. He left the glass doors open to the street and blasted Michael Jackson. He brewed pot after pot of tea, serving it to his friends, who threw around cigarettes before they sat down on the pleather-encased stools Zhuang had placed around a monstrous wooden desk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Later, the more worried Zhuang grew, the more likely it was you&#x2019;d find the store shuttered. Eventually, as the pressure increased, he gave up the business entirely and planned in his tiny apartment, still serving tea to passing friends, watching his son struggle to maintain a wobbly sit, and doing his best to put his schemes into action.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zhuang would subsequently tell people that, as he thought it over in his shop, he considered many possible destinations. An increasing number of Chinese emigrants were choosing Australia as a new home. Germany, he had heard, was welcoming. But the interest was passing. The moment he decided to leave Wukan Village, he thought of the United States. It had an allure no other country could match. It was a country of justice and freedom, a place with values that paralleled his own. He had to whisper when he said it: America. He had heard its asylum policies there were favorable, and he understood it to be a wealthy country that took care of its citizens. Work would be easy to find there. People would be friendly. Some might even know his name. He imagined a warm welcome from Western democracy advocates. He thought of returning to Wukan years later, a success. He envisioned himself on a boat passing Liberty Island, a little windblown and visibly, palpably free.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the tail end of his plan, the point at which it trailed off into a haze of hard work, success, and prosperity, was Flushing, Queens. Zhuang had carried out his scheming largely online, and had been wise enough to realize that New York City was too large a place to approach uninformed. He had skimmed through online discussion boards and squinted his one nearsighted eye at photographs. Manhattan&#x2019;s Chinatown, he decided, would be too dense and urban for his village sensibilities, and in the center of the city, real estate would most likely be expensive. Flushing, on the other hand, had become the destination of choice for most working-class immigrants from Mainland China. He looked up photos and saw a clutter of signs in Mandarin. He saw restaurants, driving schools, supermarkets, and even a sign for the Democratic Party of China. He made up his mind that this, at least temporarily, would be his destination in the United States.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Flushing, as far as Zhuang understood it, was a new, more modern kind of Chinatown. It was dominated by the working class, the result of an influx of new immigrants from new parts of China&#x2014;inland and northern provinces that had little history of exploration or emigration overseas. Flushing wasn&#x2019;t controlled by the family-based patronage systems that had once ruled Manhattan&#x2019;s Chinatown or by the human smugglers who had brought in tens of thousands of Fujianese in the 1990s. It was a neighborhood where people would speak Zhuang&#x2019;s language and the food would suit his palate. There would be opportunities for work and a community of activists who would respect him. He would make friends, explore the neighborhood, and plan his next steps from there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zhuang had no family in the United States. He spoke no English and had never graduated from middle school. But he did not worry that he might get lost in a crowd of new arrivals or have to struggle to find work. After all, he had the advantage of being at least a little famous. Journalists had been coming to his village since 2011, when he had helped catalyze a particularly explosive protest. He had given interviews and appeared on Chinese-language television. He would wait until he got to the United States to contact the journalists he knew and make a statement, but he imagined it would create quite an impression&#x2014;a man of Wukan in New York City.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>� � �</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zhuang&#x2019;s third plan, the one that would finally bring him to New York, was the simplest and least flamboyant: he would acquire two tourist visas to the United States, one for himself and the other for his wife, Little Yan. This plan had none of the daring of a maritime or midnight escape. Its difficulties were largely bureaucratic. Zhuang had to hope that the local office would ignore his history of troublemaking and issue him a passport, and that the nearest U.S. consulate would grant them the visas. Then he and Little Yan would have to find a place to keep their infant son, Kaizhi, safe. And then the pair would join a tour group. Their exit from China would be led by a distracted young woman hoisting a tiny stuffed bear on a pole, bobbing through the crowds in the Shenzhen ferry port.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If Zhuang had taken a boat, he would have traveled alone&#x2014;it would have been too dangerous for Little Yan to come with him. Once he decided to go by air, however, he felt they should travel as a couple. He presented the plan to his wife one night, sitting on the long wooden bench that passed for a sofa in most Wukan homes. Baby Kaizhi was asleep on their metal-framed bed. He</p><p>had just started to crawl, military style, around their one-room apartment during the day, bent on exploring the small concrete courtyard. Kaizhi regarded the outside world with great seriousness.</p><p>He grabbed leaves and looked at Little Yan before shoving them into his mouth. He rarely cried. He slept well. Little Yan could watch him all day long and not feel bored. She did not want to leave China.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Little Yan had known Zhuang for three years, and for three years she had stood in flattering relief to her husband. She was quiet and petite; pretty, but with a slight underbite that made her shy about smiling. She had grown up in a village in Guangxi Province, one even smaller and less prosperous than Wukan. She allowed Zhuang an air of worldliness. He could drive the conversation while she happily cooked for his friends and took care of their son. She didn&#x2019;t make too many demands or spend too much money. And she appreciated his dogged sense of right and wrong. He was honest, which was more than Little Yan could say for a lot of the men she had met in Guangdong Province.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Zhuang described his plan, Little Yan had concerns that came in quick succession, neatly pricking holes in his confidence. He had been prepared for some questions&#x2014;he had thought carefully about what to do with their son&#x2014;but she was persistent. She asked why she and Kaizhi couldn&#x2019;t follow him to the United States after he got settled. She wondered how hard it would be to get by in an English-speaking country with an English vocabulary that was almost nonexistent. She had studied the language in high school but could barely remember a word. She wanted him to delay so she could take classes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Little Yan had come to understand that the more stung Zhuang felt, the quicker and louder he was with his defenses. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t understand at all!&#x201d; he told her. He did not want the local government to suspect the couple were planning to run, he said. He worried that any delay could put him in further danger. And she was dense if she didn&#x2019;t think he was in danger. He felt sure that, the moment he gave them an excuse, local officials would send goons to arrest him. And his fiery nature would eventually give them an excuse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zhuang was more careful when he talked about Kaizhi. It was natural, he thought, that Little Yan would worry about their son&#x2014;she would always be connected to him. But the affection between two grown people might not survive across an ocean. Kaizhi could stay with Little Yan&#x2019;s parents, who would take good care of their grandson, he told her, but no one could help the two of them keep up their relationship when they were separated. It could take him years to get a green card. They would find a Chinese neighborhood, he would look for work on a fishing boat, and she could study English. Kaizhi would come as soon as they could bring him over.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Suan le ba,&#x201d;</i> she said, mid-discussion. It doesn&#x2019;t matter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was a terrible choice&#x2014;between her husband and her son&#x2014;but she did not blame Zhuang for forcing it. He made his points, and she accepted them. If he could make the escape happen, Little Yan would go with him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Escape to America had to be undertaken in steps, each with the potential to derail the entire undertaking. Zhuang was so nervous about applying for a passport that he tested the waters by first applying for a permit to visit Hong Kong. It came in a little blue booklet that said Travel Permit on the front. He then took a ferry from Shenzhen into Kowloon and wandered the streets for a few nervous days. He met with a handful of journalists he knew from his days as a protest leader and told them about his plan. He asked them to help him keep a low profile&#x2014;Zhuang</p><p>had gotten the travel documents, he guessed, because local officials were too busy to monitor him, and he didn&#x2019;t want to give them a reason to start paying attention. He talked loudly on the phone about his vacation plans, in case someone was listening in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When he went back to his village, he applied for two passports. He stood in line for over an hour, and when he was face to face with the agent, the man barely looked at his name. He purchased two suitcases in his-and-hers pink and black and hid them, just in case. He researched the weather in New York, and Little Yan invested in leggings that were nearly an inch thick with padding. They bought impossibly puffy coats, the volume-to-warmth ratio as high as might be expected in a region where winter bottoms out around fifty degrees Fahrenheit. In with his clothes, Zhuang stuck a little clay teapot, some small cups, and a plastic bag full of tea leaves. Other necessities would be easy to come by in New York. There would be time for everything once they arrived.</p></p><h2>Winthrop&#39;s Boston: Portrait of a Puritan Town, 1630-1649</h2><p>history</p><p></p><h2>Finishing Touches: A Guide to Being Poised, Polished, and Beautifully Prepared for Life</h2><p>The founding director of a top finishing school offers advice on personal appearance, including hair, jewelry, makeup and clothing, and proper behavior at parties, weddings and other social occasions</p><p>Oliver, who owns a finishing school, has written an etiquette book for the debutante set.

It&#39;s His nature. But many times we think we have to make the way ourselves. It&#39;s not until we realize that we don&#39;t know what to do that we are able to hear God&#39;s voice. God Will Make a Way is an approach to specific problems in the Christian&#39;s life, but more than that, it&#39;s a new approach to solving life itself. Drs. Cloud and Townsend introduce ten &#34;life principles&#34; and then demonstrate how eighteen real-world dilemmas are solved by their application. The book concludes with a plan to encourage each reader to develop a personal strategy for using these principles to bring about life-changing healing.</p><p>Life is difficult. Life for every person on earth is a challenging journey &#x2013; with or without God. Those who invite God to join them on this adventure believe that when bad things happen they can trust God to be present and work on their behalf. <p>But because we never know when, where, or how God is going to show up, we often wonder: Just exactly how does He go about the business of helping us when we don&#x2019;t know what to do? </p><p>Henry Cloud and John Townsend believe God has given us instructions on how He makes a way for us when we call on Him. They believe that, just as you would exercise faith in a doctor by following his advice to get well physically, if you follow God&#x2019;s eight principles in this book, you can thrive relationally, emotionally, and spiritually. </p><p>These principles offer a groundbreaking new approach to recognizing when God is present and how He works His will in our lives.THE PRINCIPLES OF THE WAY </p><p>- Begin your journey with God </p><p>- Choose your traveling companions wisely </p><p>- Place high value on wisdom </p><p>- Leave your baggage behind </p><p>- Own your faults and weaknesses </p><p>- Embrace problems as gifts </p><p>- Take life as it comes </p><p>- Love God with all you are </p><p>As clinical psychologists, the authors deal daily with real people facing real problems, so this book is not just psychological or biblical theory: In fact, Part II of God Will Make a Way shows the principles at work in twelve key areas of life: dating, marriage, sex, conflict, parenting, fear, lost love, addictions, anger, depression, weight loss, and personal goals. </p><p>God Will Make a Way is more than a remarkably helpful book.

For example, Aurora, the Sleeping Beauty, spins towards her Prince and "dives fearlessly into his arms. . . ." In "Giselle" a man "leaps along a diagonal line that the Wilis have formed" to force him to dance to death. The impact of the full-page color illustrations that accompany each plot (along with smaller black-and-white artwork) is often diluted because of poor placement. The illustration of the battle between the Nutcracker and the Mouse King is placed opposite the description of the Stahlbaum party. A picture of the Moor and the Ballerina from the third scene of "Petrouchka" is placed at the end of the tale. With only three collections of ballet plots for children currently in print, this will be a useful addition for school and public library collections.

None of the things which Kenny called his own remained. Even the painted walls and skylight were gone.</p><p>Baffled, he wondered if other things -- even outside -- had changed. Kenny went to one of the windows and looked down. On a stoop across the dark street a man was standing, gazing straight at Kenny's window. He was wearing what appeared to be a long black cape which reached his knees, and a hat, triangular in shape. Its brim obscured his face.</p><p>As if suddenly realizing he was being observed, the man moved quickly into the shadows. Keeping his face averted, he fled up the street.</p></p><p><p>Avi is the author of more than sixty books, including <em>Crispin: The Cross of Lead</em>, a Newbery Medal winner, and <em>Crispin: At the Edge of the World</em>. His other acclaimed titles include <em>The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle</em> and <em>Nothing But the Truth</em>, both Newbery Honor Books, and most recently <em>The Seer of Shadows</em>. He lives with his family in Colorado. </p>Grade 5-7 A ghost story of redeeming social value: when 12-year-old Kenny Huldorf moves with his family to Providence, Rhode Island, he finds himself embroiled in the century-old murder of a teenage slave named Caleb. Not only is Kenny haunted by the injustice of the murder, but also by the ghost of Caleb himself, who summons Kenny back in time to the early 19th Century, where the boy must solve Caleb's murder to return to his own century. How Kenny does this is the stuff of a somber and ambiguous conclusion upon which Avi intrudes himself as a character as he has earlier done at the book's beginning. Why Avi has chosen to do this is debatableperhaps to reinforce the reality of the social issue, slavery, which drives the narrative. In any event, as a literary device it compromises an otherwise carefully constructed tale, just as the too obvious employment of Caleb as both character and symbol tends to compromise his viability as a character. Nevertheless Something Upstairs is an intelligent and well-intentioned effort. It can provoke discussion of the issues articulated above as well as how, finally, violence visits the lives of both Caleb and Kenny and how Kenny, through choice and circumstance, may have become a slave himself.

This book celebrates the deeply felt relationships between these Aboriginal peoples, the land, and their sacred heritage of the Dreamtime. <br><br>All aspects of Aboriginal life derive their ultimate context from the Dreamtime&#x2014;the primordial creation epoch that Aborigines have reenacted in ceremony since time immemorial&#x2014;and from the essence they share with their Spirit Ancestors. This sacred source, known as the Law, underlies every activity of these people, fills all aspects of daily life with sacred purpose, and creates an enduring sense of connection for them to the land and to each other. Myth, kinship, song, dance and ceremony are all interwoven within a spiritual tradition that extends back into the timeless past and forward into an eternal future. Women and men occupy distinctly separate yet complementary spheres, each with its own unique traditions. And rituals celebrate every transition in life&#x2014;from conception and birth, through entry into adulthood, to the ceremonies that make up "women's business" and "men's business," to the various stages of maturation, old age, and death. <br><br> <i>Wisdom from the Earth </i> illuminates many facets of Aboriginal cultures and explores a number of the major Dreamtime songlines, ceremonies, and other spiritual practices, through eighty-two stunning color photographs accompanied by text&#x2014;including some unforgettable dialogues with Aboriginal elders.</p><p>Bruce Chatwin's <i>The Songlines</i> brought the magic of Australian Aboriginal dreamtime to an audience far beyond the shores of the great island continent. Now Anna Voigt and Nevill Drury re-create this complex spirituality through photographs and accounts of ritual and social life in <i>Wisdom from the Earth</i>. The photographs jump off the pages: Uluru (Ayers Rock), the sacred convergence of the songlines, "a huge red monolith" abruptly rising 400 meters above the land; painted women singing the ancient myths; pointillist paintings of the exploits of the spirit ancestors; men dancing in ceremonial regalia; wildlife and sites along seemingly barren landscapes, each with its own story and place in the scheme of life. The text fleshes out the photographs, detailing dreamtime events, describing nonsecret ceremonies and their roles in Aboriginal life, and recording interviews with elders. The effect is an eye-opening glimpse of the rich and enduring traditions of Aboriginal spirituality. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Nevill Drury is the author of more than forty books, including <i>Elements of Shamanism, Echoes from the Void, The Visionary Human, </i>and <i>Images in Contemporary Australian Painting. </i></p><h2>Between River and Sea: Encounters in Israel and Palestine</h2><p>Dervla Murphy describes with passionate honesty the experience of her most recent journeys into Israel and Palestine.

A young woman returns from holiday to find her elderly neighbour dead on the floor. A heart attack seems the likely cause, but Commissario Brunetti is not so sure and decides to take a closer look. Soon he discovers that she was part of an organization that cares for abused women and that her apartment was a safe-house. Convinced that this is the lead he has been looking for, Brunetti begins his search for answers. But as he sets out to discover the truth behind her death, he is drawn into a decades-old story of lies and deceit that has blighted love and ruined lives - and has claimed this innocent woman as its newest victim.</p><p>Donna Leon was named by The Times as one of the 50 Greatest Crime Writers. She is an award-winning crime novelist, celebrated for the bestselling Brunetti series. Donna has lived in Venice for thirty years and previously lived in Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, Iran and China, where she worked as a teacher. Donna&#39;s books have been translated into 35 languages and have been published around the world. Her previous novels featuring Commissario Brunetti have all been highly acclaimed; including Friends in High Places, which won the CWA Macallan Silver Dagger for Fiction, Fatal Remedies, Doctored Evidence, A Sea of Troubles and Beastly Things.*Starred Review* Leons twentieth novel starring Venetian police commissario Guido Brunetti is one of her best. But why? Not because she breaks new ground, either in terms of the characters or the story. This tale of the murder of a retired teacher who was helping abused women escape their abusers offers a sensitive but never by-the-numbers exploration of a contemporary social problem, as do many of the other novels in the series, and it takes plenty of breaks between the crime-solving to portray fan favorite Brunetti the family man, interacting joyously with his wife and children. It also delivers a typically Leon-style ambiguous ending in which traditional justice is either less important than or even detrimental to Brunettis real concern: doing his best to set things right for the various troubled souls he encounters in the course of his investigation. So what makes the book stand out? Its simply this: Brunetti walks around Venice a lot in this novel, and when he walks, he muses. And when he muses, the reader listens almost hypnotically, transfixed by the somehow ennobling ordinariness of this remarkable mans humanity but also by the subtlety of his mind and his absolute refusal to succumb to the tyranny of bureaucrats and moralists. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Leons popularity among mystery fans has grown steadily, but over the last several years, she has become a must-read for all those who favor character-driven crime stories. She is especially popular in libraries and among librarian mystery readers. --Bill Ott</p><h2>Religion, Politics, and the Christian Right: Post-9/11 Powers in American Empire</h2><p>Princeton theologian Mark Taylor analyzes right-wing Christian movements in the United States amid the powers of religion, politics, empire, and corporate classes in post-9/11 USA. The real gift of Taylor&#39;s book is his argument that this militant Christian faith must be viewed against a backdrop of the American political romanticism and corporatist liberalism of U.S. past and present. Taylor uses the best of cultural and historical studies, while deftly drawing lessons for American readers from theologian Paul Tillich&#39;s analysis of power and religion during the rise of fascism and nationalism in Germany of the 1930s. The result is an innovative framework for interpreting how Christian nationalists, Pentagon war planners and corporate institutions today are forging alliances in the U.S. that have dramatic and destructive global impact. Moving beyond lament, Taylor also leaves readers with a new romance of revolutionary traditions and a new more radical liberalism, revitalizing American visions of spirit that are both prophetic and public for U.S. residents today.</p><p>Mark Lewis Taylor is the Maxwell M. Upson Professor of Theology and Culture at Princeton Theological Seminary. Among his many publications is The Executed God: The Way of the Cross in Lockdown America (Fortress Press).

Simon Jenkins&#39;s &#34;Short History of England,&#34; published in association with the National Trust, is a handsome book whose narrative gains strength as it goes through the Middle Ages and finds itself in the modern period. His account of the 20th century is full of the good judgements one might hope for from such a sensible and readable commentator, and they alone are worth perusing for pleasure and food for thought. Jenkins is especially good at analysing what he sees as the central idea - the balance between royal power and popular consent.&#34; &#34;Kirkus Reviews,&#34; October 26, 2011 &#34;The book is elevated by the author&#39;s engaging writing style, and he does a remarkable job with English royal history from 1066 to 1714, demonstrating how the individual kings and queens fit together into one coherent story...A broad, accessible history for those readers not well versed in English history.&#34; &#34;City AM&#34; (UK) September 15, 2011 &#34;Dip into a chapter of an evening and let Jenkins sweep you through England&#39;s history, painting a vivid picture of this country&#39;s green and pleasant land.&#34; &#34;Pros</p><h2>Rainbow Magic: Elsa the Mistletoe Fairy</h2><p>Elsa the Mistletoe Fairy</p><p></p><h2>Drugs Are Nice: A Post-Punk Memoir</h2><p>In this eye-opening memoir, Lisa Crystal Carver recalls her extraordinary youth and charts the late-80s, early-90s punk subculture that she helped shape. She recounts how her band Suckdog was born in 1987 and the wild events that followed: leaving small-town New Hampshire to tour Europe at 18, becoming a teen publisher of fanzines, a teen bride, and a teen prostitute. <i>Spin</i> has called Suckdog's album <i>Drugs Are Nice</i> one of the best of the '90s, and the book includes photos of infamous European shows. Yet the book also tells of how Lisa saw the need for change in 1994, when her baby was born with a chromosomal deletion and his father became violent. With lasting lightness and surprising gravity, <i>Drugs Are Nice</i> is a definitive account of the generation that wanted to break every rule, but also a story of an artist and a mother becoming an adult on her own terms.</p><p>Lisa Crystal Carver (born 1968[1]), also known as Lisa Suckdog, is an American writer known for her writing in Rollerderby. She started touring with the performance art band Psycodrama when she was 18 years old. It was also at this time that she became a prostitute, which has been a major theme in her writings over the years. She began touring with Costes a year later, and would also tour without him when he was in France. She toured the U.S. and Europe six times, the last time in 1998. The noise music soap operas included audience interaction including dancing and mock-rape of audience members. Carver is the also the author of Dancing Queen: a Lusty Look at the American Dream, in which she expounds upon various relics of pop culture past, including Lawrence Welk, roller rinks, and Olivia Newton-John. In 2005, Soft Skull Press released her newest book, Drugs Are Nice, detailing her early childhood and later romantic relationships with Costes, Boyd Rice and Smog&#39;s Bill Callahan. In addition to writing her own zines and books, Carver has also written for various magazines (including Peter Bagge&#39;s comic book Hate) and kept a fictionalized journal about her sex life for the website Nerve. Although Carver no longer writes her journal for the site, she is still a semi-regular contributor. The online Journal at Nerve was subsequently published in book form as The Lisa Diaries: Four Years in the Sex Life of Lisa Carver and Company."Carver's observations are dead-on and she tackles everything with a sharp, clean honesty." -- <i><i>Chicago Reader</i></i><br><br>"The 31-year-old married mother from Dover may well be the country's supreme cultural anthropologist: part literary provocateur, part social analyst. She's been called everything from this decade's ultimate underground Renaissance woman to America's horniest optimist. Hunter S. Thompson in a miniskirt." -- <i><i>Boston Magazine</i></i><br><br>"When Newt Gingrich wakes up sweating in the middle of the night with a hard-on and a sense of nameless dread, the face that he sees might be Lisa Carver's." -- <i><i>Time Out New York</i></i><br><br>"With her tart writing and unswerving devotion to lowbrow culture, Carver sound like Camille Paglia channeling both Tonya Harding and Liz Phair." -- <i>Dwight Garner, <i>Details</i></i><br><br>Shock-performance artist Carver (<i>Dancing Queen</i>) offers a spunky, well-fashioned memoir devoid of self-pity but heavy on moral-of-the-story hindsight. Carver grew up in Dover, N.H., with a sickly mother, but spent her 15th year with her father in California, when he got out of prison for murder. His hard-knock lessons "shame and shock [her] out of everything [she] knew to be and think," so that when she returned to Dover, she was transformed and fearless. Meeting "scum-rocker" GG Allin inspired her and a friend to start a "band," Suckdog, and join the wave of atonal, angry prankster gigs then in vogue (it was the late 1980s). Connected to the DIY underground, a cassette-trading society that eliminates the need for producers, seed money, even talent, Carver met and married French music rebel Jean Louis Costes; together they achieved notoriety with their outlandish performances (one act involved her peeing in a litter box). Other jobs include publishing the early zine <i>Rollerderby</i>, which segues into an infatuation with the troubled neo-Nazi Boyd Rice. Carver had Rice's child, born genetically disabled, and the family collapsed when Rice revealed himself to be an abusive alcoholic. Carver slides into a chirpy concluding regeneration, while the overall ride of this iconoclast is surprisingly tame. Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

By the time she discovered her mistake, the habit was too deeply ingrained to give up. She lives in England.</p><b>Woman of Consequence, A</b><br><i><b>Chapter One</b></i><i>Badleigh Vicarage, Wednesday, 8</i><i>th</i> <i>October 1806</i>&nbsp;<br><i>My dear Eliza,</i><i>I promised yesterday that just as soon as I had leisure for writing I should send you a full and satisfactory account of Penelope Lambe's accident at Madderstone Abbey; and so I shall begin upon it. Though I fear I may have to leave off at any moment, for there is a great deal of needlework to be done for the little boys at school and Margaret has already opened her workbox and begun to look at me with displeasure.</i><i>In yesterday's note I was kind enough to hint at some</i> <i>very peculiar circumstances</i> <i>surrounding Penelope's fall and I do not doubt that since receiving it you have enjoyed all the apprehensions and heightened imaginings which such hints can supply. And I trust my account will not disappoint you, for it was a</i> <i>very</i> <i>strange business indeed - one which I cannot, yet, understand at all.</i><i>The first thing you must know is that it all came about because of the ghost - I mean, of course, the Grey Nun of Madderstone.</i><i>And, by the by, it occurs to me</i> ...'Well, Dido,' said Mrs Margaret Kent heavily, 'I daresay that when <i>I</i> was unmarried <i>I</i> had leisure for writing long letters.' She regarded her sister-in-law with the tragic aspectof a saint bound for the pagan arena in Rome. 'I declare it is more than a fortnight since I touched my writing desk.''Yes,' said the unrepentant Dido without ceasing to move her pen. 'It is quite one of the evils of matrimony, is it not?'&nbsp;<br>... <i>it occurs to me, Eliza, that the Grey Nun is a remarkably important lady. The possession of a family ghost confers such dignity! I believe that every family which has any claim at all to grandeur should have a ghost. I consider it a kind of necessary which should be attended to as soon as the fortune is made and the country estate purchased.</i><i>Everyone's</i> <i>consequence is increased by the presence of a ghost.</i><i>For here are the two Crockford sisters, who are no more than some kind of third cousins to the Harman-Footes of Madderstone, but they must walk their visitor, Penelope, two miles across the fields to see the Grey Nun. Well, not perhaps quite her, for she cannot of course be relied upon to be always at home to morning callers - but at least the ruins in which she is reputed to appear.</i><i>I said to Penelope, when I was invited to accompany them, 'It is not enough, you know, that we should entertain you with parties and visits while you are here in Badleigh. We cannot send you back to your school in Bath without first chilling your blood and supplying you with nightmares to last a twelvemonth.'</i><i>And she, I discovered, was very grateful for the attention. For she had 'never set foot in a</i> <i>real</i> <i>abbey before' and she did 'most sincerely hope that it was</i> <i>very</i> <i>dreadful and just</i> <i>exactly</i> <i>like what one read about in books</i> ...'<i>Well, she is a sweet-tempered, good-natured girl and sovery pretty that I always find great pleasure in looking at her - but I do not believe that she has more than common sense. However, since she is now lying abed with an injured head, I ought not to speak ill of her, and I confess that her eager naivety suits my taste a great deal better than Lucy Crockford's studied sensibility.</i><i>All the while that we were walking to Madderstone</i> ...'It is a great pity,' said Margaret loudly, 'that Eliza is not here. <i>She</i> is a very fine needlewoman.''It is extremely kind of you to say so, Margaret. I shall be sure to pass on the compliment.''And so very obliging. Why, last spring, she sewed three shirts for little Frank in as many days.''Did she indeed? How remarkable!' Dido resolutely continued with her letter, but a glance across the green baize of the parlour table had shown colour mounting in Margaret's broad cheeks, her narrow mouth tightening. If there was not to be a state of warfare in the house, she must soon lay her pen aside. As she bent her head further over her page she rather fancied that she felt, prickling through her cap, not only the heat of autumn sunshine magnified by the window, but also a disapproving gaze.And yet she could not help but try for a few lines more:&nbsp;<br><i>All the while that we were walking to Madderstone, Lucy was talking in her slowest, most languishing tones of the '</i><i>extraordinary</i> <i>atmosphere of melancholy which haunts the ruins.' An atmosphere to which she is herself 'most</i> <i>extraordinarily</i> <i>sensitive.' For 'no one - no one in the world - feels these things more acutely' than she does. And there have been times when she has been 'almost overwhelmed bythe</i> <i>extraordinary</i> <i>atmosphere of the ruins</i> ...'<i>So those two continued to talk of ghosts, with only an occasional digression in praise of Captain Laurence - who, I suppose, must be considered a secondary motive for our visit to Madderstone Abbey.</i><i>And, by the by, I cannot help but wonder that Lucy and Penelope should contrive to be both in love with the captain without any cooling of affection between themselves. Nor can I quite determine whether it argues most for the sweetness of their natures, the weakness of their understanding - or only the insignificance of their attachment to the gentleman.</i>&nbsp;<br>The sunny silence of the room was broken by Margaret's searching noisily in the workbasket for a spool of thread. Dido began to write faster:&nbsp;<br><i>Harriet Crockford, I noticed, scowled darkly whenever her sister talked of the captain; I do not think she has a very high opinion of him. But I could not prevail upon her to discuss this interesting topic. And, while nuns and the navy were canvassed by the other two, Harriet and I were much less pleasantly engaged. It was roof leads and damp in the kitchen passage all the way with us.</i><i>Harriet informs me that there is a hole in the roof at Ashfield which is a yard and three-quarters long and twenty-seven inches broad. It would, I am further informed, 'break Dear Papa's heart' if he could see the hole in Ashfield's roof. And, if my memory were only a little better, I could relate to you the exact cost of the tiles and lead which will be required to repair it.</i><i>Poor Harriet: there are times when she goes beyond being sensible and is downright dull. And it is very disconcertingthat a woman who is more than two years my junior can seem so very</i> <i>old</i><i>. I find myself wishing that she would not wear such a dowdy bonnet, nor such a large and unbecoming cap beneath it; and I begin to despair of her ever having an original thought - I believe she only lives to reflect the ideas of dear dead Papa</i> ...<i>But now I am getting quite off the point. It is such a very great pleasure and relief to 'talk' to you, Eliza, that I cannot stop my pen from running away with me.</i><i>I must return to that woman of consequence: the Grey Nun. For it would seem that yesterday she was indeed at home to callers! Or so Lucy believes.</i>&nbsp;<br>There was another, louder, sigh from the other side of the table.'Well, well, I suppose you have nothing else to occupy your time,' said Margaret, 'but I confess that it makes me quite <i>envious</i> to see you writing away all day.' There followed some vigorous stabbing at a shirtsleeve. 'The truth is,' she continued, 'that when your cottage was given up and it was proposed that you should come to live with us, I told your brother: "Francis, my dear," I said, "I am sure I shall do all that I can for your poor sisters, but I do not know how I shall manage - with all the business I have to attend to - I do not know <i>how</i> I shall manage with having a <i>visitor</i> constantly in my house."'It was too much. Reminded of her dependence, Dido bit her lip, set aside her pen - and reached for the workbasket.A WOMAN OF CONSEQUENCE. Copyright � 2010 by Anna Dean. All rights reserved.

Set on board the QE2, and in New York and Liverpool, Gut Symmetries explores parallel lives, loves and universes.</p><p>Physics seems to have become the new language of love in the 1990s, and Jeanette Winterson is not the first writer to make a major character a physicist. Jonathan Lethem mined similar territory earlier this year in his delightful book, <i>As She Climbed Across the Table,</i> and now Winterson enters the lists with not one, but two physicists populating the pages of her equally wonderful book, <i>Gut Symmetries</i>. If you think about it, physics <i>does</i> make a good metaphor for love, encompassing as it does the principles of attraction, the exchange of energy, and unification. At the center of this meditation on "the intelligence of the universe" and "the stupidity of humankind" are Jove, a married physicist; Alice, a single physicist who becomes his mistress; and Stella, Jove's wife and later, Alice's lover. They meet on the <i>QE2</i> and from there the three participants in the story take turns telling their versions of it. <p> <i>Gut Symmetries</i> is a collage of memories, snippets of scientific theory, meditations on abstract concepts like truth, and the events surrounding Jove, Alice, and Stella's affair. This is a book that demands your attention, jumping as it does from one seemingly tangential topic to another; but whereas physics still seeks a grand unification theory (GUT) to explain how everything in the universe fits together, Winterson actually finds one of her own in this satisfyingly complete fictional world.</p>The highwire artist of the English novel redraws the romantic triangle for the post-Einsteinian universe, where gender is as elastic as matter, and any accurate Grand Unified Theory (GUT) must encompass desire alongside electromagnetism and gravity. <br>One starry night on a boat in the mid-Atlantic, Alice, a brilliant English theoretical physicist, begins an affair with Jove, her remorselessly seductive American counterpart. But Jove is married. When Alice confronts his wife, Stella, she swiftly falls in love with her, with consequences that are by turns horrifying, comic, and arousing. Vaulting from Liverpool to New York, from alchemy to string theory, and from the spirit to the flesh, Gut Symmetries is a thrillingly original novel by England's most flamboyantly gifted young writer. <br>"Winterson is unmatched among contemporary writers in her ability to conjure up new-world wonder...A beautiful, stirring and brilliant story."--Times Literary Supplement <br>"Dazzling for [its] intelligence and inventiveness...[Winterson] is possessed of a masterly command of the language and a truly pliant imagination."--Elle <br>"One of our most brilliant, visionary storytellers."--San Francisco Chronicle</p><h2>The Age of Edison: Electric Light and the Invention of Modern America (Penguin History American Life)</h2><p>The late nineteenth century was a period of explosive technological creativity, but arguably the most important invention of all was Thomas Edison&#x2019;s incandescent lightbulb. Unveiled in his Menlo Park, New Jersey, laboratory in 1879, the lightbulb overwhelmed the American public with the sense of the birth of a new age. More than any other invention, the electric light marked the arrival of modernity.<br><br>The lightbulb became a catalyst for the nation&#x2019;s transformation from a rural to an urban-dominated culture. City streetlights defined zones between rich and poor, and the electrical grid sharpened the line between town and country. &#x201c;Bright lights&#x201d; meant &#x201c;big city.&#x201d; Like moths to a flame, millions of Americans migrated to urban centers in these decades, leaving behind the shadow of candle and kerosene lamp in favor of the exciting brilliance of the urban streetscape.<br><br><i>The Age of Edison </i>places the story of Edison&#x2019;s invention in the context of a technological revolution that transformed America and Europe in these decades. Edison and his fellow inventors emerged from a culture shaped by broad public education, a lively popular press that took an interest in science and technology, and an American patent system that encouraged innovation and democratized the benefits of invention. And in the end, as Freeberg shows, Edison&#x2019;s greatest invention was not any single technology, but rather his reinvention of the process itself. At Menlo Park he gathered the combination of capital, scientific training, and engineering skill that would evolve into the modern research and development laboratory. His revolutionary electrical grid not only broke the stronghold of gas companies, but also ushered in an era when strong, clear light could become accessible to everyone.<br><br>In <i>The Age of Edison</i>, Freeberg weaves a narrative that reaches from Coney Island and Broadway to the tiniest towns of rural America, tracing the progress of electric light through the reactions of everyone who saw it. It is a quintessentially American story of ingenuity, ambition, and possibility, in which the greater forces of progress and change are made visible by one of our most humble and ubiquitous objects.</p><p>Ernest Freeberg is a distinguished professor of humanities in the history department at the University of Tennessee. He is the author of <i>The Education of Laura Bridgman</i> and <i>Democracy&#x2019;s Prisoner</i>, which was a <i>Los Angeles Times </i>Book Prize finalist and winner of the David J. Langum, Sr. Prize in American Legal History and the Eli M. Oboler Award from the American Library Association&#x2019;s Intellectual Freedom Roundtable. Freeberg is a distinguished lecturer for the Organization of American Historians and has produced a number of public radio documentaries on historical themes."Mr. Freeberg's broad research adds up to a vivid social history with parallels for today's technology innovators and for those who wish to increase their number. It underscores the point that the work of Edison and other pioneers of light took place in an unusual setting, a period in which American invention was remarkably active and fertile... <i>The Age of Edison</i> comes at a fitting time, the close of the era of the incandescent light. When the old stocks of incandescents run out, it may be the end of pleasant illumination at a cheap price&#x2014;that is, until another Thomas Edison finds a way."<br>&#x2014;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>&#x201c;Freeberg takes us on a captivating intellectual adventure that offers long-forgotten stories of the birth pangs of the electrical age that are amusing, surprising and tragic.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2014;Washington Post</i><br><br>"One of the many pleasures of <i>Age of Edison</i>, Ernest Freeberg's engaging history of the spread of electricity throughout the United States, is that he captures the excitement and wonder of those early days, when 'a machine that could create enough cheap and powerful light to hold the night at bay' promised 'liberation from one of the primordial limits imposed by nature on the human will'... Freeberg's thoughtful and thought-provoking book quietly suggests that, to properly distribute and control such a powerful force, commercial initiative and a sense of civic responsibility were equally essential."<br>&#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>"A dynamo of a book powered by an infectious enthusiasm for the can-do spirit of Edison and rival geniuses racing to turn night into day.

One of the world&#x2019;s most widely acclaimed restaurateurs, his influence on food and hospitality can be found at the highest levels of haute-cuisine to the food trucks you frequent during the work week&#x2014;this is the Nobu that the public knows.<br> <br> But now, we are finally introduced to the private Nobu: the man who failed three times before starting the restaurant that would grow into an empire; the man who credits the love and support of his wife and children as the only thing keeping him from committing suicide when his first restaurant burned down; and the man who values the busboy who makes sure each glass is crystal clear as highly as the chef who slices the fish for Omakase perfectly.<br> <br> What makes Nobu special, and what made him famous, is the spirit of what exists on these pages. He has the traditional Japanese perspective that there is great pride to be found in every element of doing a job well&#x2014;no matter how humble that job is. Furthermore, he shows us repeatedly that success is as much about perseverance in the face of adversity as it is about innate talent.<br> <br> Not just for serious foodies, this inspiring memoir is perfect for fans of Marie Kondo&#x2019;s <i>The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up </i>and Danny Meyer&#x2019;s <i>Setting the Table.</i> Nobu&#x2019;s writing does what he does best&#x2014;it marries the philosophies of East and West to create something entirely new and remarkable.</p><p>Nobuyuki Matsuhisa&#x2014;known to the world simply as &#x201c;Nobu&#x201d;&#x2014;is the acclaimed and highly influential chef proprietor of Nobu and Matsuhisa restaurants located across five continents. He worked at the restaurant Matsue Sushi in Shinjuku, Tokyo, for seven years and was invited by a regular customer, who was a Peruvian entrepreneur of Japanese descent, to open a Japanese restaurant in Peru. At the age of twenty-four, he moved to Lima and opened a restaurant with the same name of Matsuei in partnership with his sponsor. In 1977, he moved to Los Angeles and opened his own restaurant in Beverly Hills ten years later. The restaurant quickly became a hot spot and was frequented by Hollywood celebrities, including Robert De Niro, who invited Nobu to set up a restaurant in Tribeca. In August 1994, the two opened up Nobu to critical acclaim. He now has forty-one restaurants and seven hotels around the world.Nobu 1<p></p> Drawn to Foreign Lands and Sushi<p></p> <br>Thanks to my years as an apprentice<br> <br>LONGING TO TRAVEL LIKE MY FATHER<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t remember my childhood in much detail. Instead, fragmented images flash through my mind.<br> <br>My father ran a lumber business in Sugito, a town in Saitama Prefecture. Sometimes he went overseas to buy lumber. He must have been a busy man. The last of his four children, I have almost no memories of playing with him. What I do remember is the warmth of his back when I rode behind him on his motorcycle. He often took me with him when he went places for work. It was the 1950s, and much of Saitama remained undeveloped. I loved speeding through the beautiful countryside, slicing through the wind while clinging to the back of this man whom I admired so much.<br> <br>One day, I returned home from school to find my father about to leave. I held on to the back of his motorcycle and insisted that he take me, too. I must have really pestered him, because I remember that someone finally took a photo of us together, my father astride the bike and me standing on the back with my hands on his shoulders. But my father said he was going too far to take me with him and left alone. I can still see his back receding into the distance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was a June afternoon, just two months after I began elementary school.<br> <br>The next image is of my father in a hospital bed, covered in blood and groaning in pain. He&#x2019;d been in an accident. This scene is followed by one of his funeral. Many relatives were there.<br> <br>My memories jump like this from one scene to another.<br> <br>Never again would I cling to my father&#x2019;s back and ride through the wind. Never again would he hoist me onto his shoulders. Never again would we play catch together. I think it took some time for this to sink in.<br> <br>I was so jealous when I saw my friends riding on their fathers&#x2019; shoulders or playing catch together. Sometimes I felt lonely, wondering why my father had to die. At those times, I would look at his photo. In it, he&#x2019;s standing in front of what looks like a palm tree. Beside him is a local man dressed only in a loincloth. Later, I learned that this photo was taken during the Second World War when my father went to Palau to buy lauan wood. In those days, few Japanese civilians traveled overseas on business. I was very proud of him for traveling all alone to unexplored territory. And I felt the pull of distant lands myself. &#x201c;When I grow up, I want to go overseas just like my father,&#x201d; I thought. That was my first dream.<br> <br>INHERITING MY GRANDMOTHER&#x2019;S FIGHTING SPIRIT<br> <br>The Matsuhisa family had lost its main breadwinner. My mother must have been at a complete loss when my father died so suddenly. Although she had helped him with his work, she didn&#x2019;t even know the price of the company&#x2019;s products. Once I remember her saying, &#x201c;Your father came to see me last night.&#x201d; Perhaps she had dreamed of him.<br> <br>The customers demanded to know what she was going to do. She consulted my eldest brother, Noboru, who was then in grade twelve, but my second-eldest brother, Keiichi, intervened. &#x201c;Let him graduate from high school,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take a year off.&#x201d; He helped my mother until Noboru graduated the following spring and then reenrolled in grade ten while Noboru took over the company.<br> <br>Noboru&#x2019;s grades were good, and he had planned to go on to university and become a doctor. My father&#x2019;s death, however, meant that he had to give up this dream. For a while, he became quite sullen and angry, perhaps due to the stress. Sometimes he drank and vented his frustration on my mother. In retrospect, I can see how hard it must have been for both of them.<br> <br>Because of our situation, I spent most of my time with my grandmother. Born in the Meiji era (1868&#x2013;1912), a time of great social upheaval in Japan, she was strong-willed and an avid pro wrestling fan. Rikidozan was her favorite wrestler. One day, I got into a fight and came home crying. She scolded me, but not for fighting or for crying. In those days, schoolboys still wore geta, or heavy wooden sandals. &#x201c;Why did you come back with your geta on?&#x201d; she demanded. &#x201c;If they made you mad enough to cry, at least throw your geta at them before coming home!&#x201d; Perhaps it&#x2019;s from her that I inherited my fighting spirit, which forces me back on my feet whenever I fall.<br> <br>THE DAY I DECIDED TO BECOME A SUSHI CHEF<br> <br>When I was a child, I slept near the kitchen. I would wake every morning to the tap-tap of the knife on the cutting board, the scraping of the pot against the burner, the sound of water gushing from the kitchen faucet, and the savory aroma of soup stock and miso as my mother made soup. She was the old-fashioned type of housewife who kneaded the fermented rice bran in the pickling crock every day. She was a good cook, too. Although not the type to make elaborate, time-consuming dishes, she could whip up a meal without wasting time and effort, using whatever ingredients happened to be on hand. It made her happy to see us enjoy her cooking. She must have been incredibly busy, juggling both the business and the housework, but mealtime when I was a boy was fun. My first memories of food come from the joy of our family gathered around the dinner table.<br> <br> <br>The photo of my father that I always looked at as a child.<br><br>One day, my eldest brother, Noboru, took me to Uokou, a sushi bar in front of the local train station. It must have been when I was still in junior high school. Back then, sushi was a special treat ordered in for guests, and we would be lucky to get any that was left over. There was no such thing as conveyor belt sushi, and going to a sushi restaurant was extra special. I expect that I behaved like a spoiled brat and insisted that Noboru take me. He ducked under the noren (shop curtain) and slid open the door. I peered around him to see inside. The sushi chefs behind the counter called out, &#x201c;Irasshai!&#x201d; (meaning &#x201c;welcome&#x201d;). I felt very nervous, as if I were sneaking into an adult world where kids didn&#x2019;t belong. Yet, at the same time, I was spellbound by the microcosm of the sushi bar into which I had stepped for the first time in my life.<br> <br>Seeing how nervous I was, Noboru ordered for me. The distinctive fragrance of vinegared rice and the swift, unerring movements of the chefs captivated me. &#x201c;Toro, gyoku, shako, agari, sabi&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; I hadn&#x2019;t a clue what they were saying, but the sound of the words that flew back and forth made my heart sing. Then, pieces of sushi, made especially for me, were placed on the counter, and I popped them in my mouth. They were really and truly delicious.<br> <br>The restaurant, the movements of the sushi chefs, the exchanges across the counter, the conversations among the customers themselves, the sheen of the sushi toppings, the aroma of sushi rice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was all the coolest thing ever. I decided then and there that I wanted to become a sushi chef. This became my second dream.<br> <br>Before that, I had been drawn to such professions as gym teacher or soldier in the Self-Defense Forces. These worlds seemed dynamic and disciplined. Actually, I now see that they share something in common with the precise movements of a sushi chef. Those were the kinds of things that attracted me when I was young. But although I was drawn to foreign lands and sushi, it did not yet occur to me to choose a path in life that would fulfill those dreams. I had been born into the lumber business and, just like Keiichi, my second-eldest brother, I went on to Omiya Technical High School. There I joined the boys&#x2019; cheerleading squad. Again, I think I chose it because I loved dynamic action.<br> <br>DRIVING WITHOUT A LICENSE AND GETTING EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL<br> <br>I fell in with the wrong crowd in my hometown. When I was in eleventh grade, a gang of friends gathered at my house the night before our end-of-term exams. Supposedly, we were going to study, but once everyone else in the house was asleep, we decided to take Keiichi&#x2019;s car out for a spin. I snuck the key from his room and started the engine. Of course, none of us had a license to drive.<br> <br>I got behind the wheel and drove out onto National Route 4. It was the middle of the night, but there was more traffic than I had expected. It was 1963, the year before the first Tokyo Olympics, and construction was booming in Tokyo. Dump trucks zoomed back and forth day and night. There is nothing scarier than a cocky driver without a license. I pulled out and passed one truck after another. But when I tried to pass one more, I slammed into a car coming from the opposite direction. Our vehicle flipped and then rolled several times before it was hit by another car.<br> <br>Ambulances and police cars soon arrived on the scene. At the sight of the damage, a policeman asked, &#x201c;Where are the bodies?&#x201d; My friends and I were shaking uncontrollably, certain that our lives were over. Amazingly, however, all of us, including me, were unscathed, and the people in the other vehicles had escaped with only minor injuries. It was nothing short of a miracle. The memory of that crash still sends shivers down my spine. I am convinced that my father protected us.<br> <br>Since then I have had several other close shaves that make me shudder, experiences where one wrong move would have ended my life. Yet each time, some invisible power has saved me in ways that can only be described as miraculous. And each time, I have felt that my father was watching out for me.<br> <br>I used to talk to my father&#x2019;s photo when things weren&#x2019;t going well, especially when I was younger. To be honest, I spent most of my time complaining rather than praying to him. &#x201c;Why&#x2019;d you have to go and die?&#x201d; I would say. &#x201c;Why aren&#x2019;t you here to help me now when things are so rough?&#x201d; As I talked, I would feel a weight lift from my chest. Recently, I have finally reached the stage where, instead of complaining, I place my palms together and thank him from the bottom of my heart. Perhaps it&#x2019;s a sign that I&#x2019;ve finally grown up.<br> <br>But to return to my story, the day after the accident, I didn&#x2019;t sit for the exams. Having been informed of what happened, the school understandably expelled me. They really had no choice considering that I had caused a major accident. To top it off, the court ordered that I was to be placed under probation until the age of twenty. My mother must have been worried sick, yet instead of reproaching me, she never mentioned the accident. I think the fact that she believed in me is what kept me from taking the wrong path. I began helping out with the family business instead of going to school, but my dream of becoming a sushi chef did not fade.<br> <br>THREE YEARS OF WASHING DISHES AND DELIVERING SUSHI<br> <br>I&#x2019;m pretty sure that I consulted my mother or Noboru about my aspirations. The master of Uokou, the sushi bar in front of our local station where Noboru had once taken me, introduced me to the owner of a sushi bar in Shinjuku. As I had no way of judging which shop was a good one, I went where I was told. On June tenth, in my seventeenth year, I took my first step as an apprentice chef at Matsuei-sushi.<br> <br>I had never lived away from home before, but now I shared one large room in the back of the restaurant with the two other staff. The sushi bar was closed just two days a month, and those were our only days off. Because we were live-in staff, there was a curfew. Even on our holidays, we had to be back by ten at night. The owner and his wife were quite strict about this, probably because I was underage and they felt responsible. My workday began early in the morning. Every day, I got on the bus with my boss and headed to the Tsukiji fish market. I followed after him with a basket to carry the fish he bought. I learned how to tell a good fish by watching him choose.<br> <br>This was also a time of day when I could enjoy small acts of kindness. A vegetable broker might give me a bun to eat, or sometimes my boss would buy me something I could never have afforded. I still remember the times he treated me to eel or pork cutlet on curry and rice.<br> <br>Back at the restaurant, it was time to prepare. For me, food prep consisted of the most basic tasks, such as scaling and beheading small fish. I was not particularly skillful with my hands. My only strength was my determination to keep up with the others. I couldn&#x2019;t stand being beaten even at such simple tasks as prepping shad or conger eel. The fishermen at Tsukiji market could dress a fish with a few fluid movements, and I often watched them while they worked, hoping to learn how they did it so quickly and efficiently.<br> <br>Once prep work was done, my coworkers would start grilling eel, and the owner&#x2019;s wife would mix the sushi rice. Then it was lunch hour. When the sushi bar was open, I was stationed at the far end of the counter where I washed dishes, made tea, grated wasabi, and cut leaf garnishes. I also delivered takeout orders.<br> <br>A COMBINATION PLATTER FOR BASEBALL STAR SADAHARU OH<br> <br>Before I could start delivering orders on my own, I first had to learn where all the customers lived. One of them was homerun king Sadaharu Oh, who played for the Yomiuri Giants. My boss was a graduate of Waseda Jitsugyo High School and so was Oh. Through this connection, Oh had become a regular, and an autographed photo of him hung on the wall in the restaurant.<br> <br>At the time, Oh was the main batter for the Giants but had not yet attained international fame. He wasn&#x2019;t married yet, either. When he finished a game at Korakuen Stadium, his mother would phone us and order &#x201c;the usual for Sadaharu.&#x201d; Matsuei-sushi had a special combination platter of sushi and sashimi just for Oh. The boss would make it, and I would deliver it. Sometimes Oh would drive up just as I arrived, and I would direct him as he backed into the driveway.<br> <br>Although I was nominally an apprentice sushi chef, I spent the first three years washing dishes and making deliveries. Some of my high school friends were now working, and they brought their girlfriends to the restaurant when they got their paychecks, but I had no skills with which to impress them. While I was happy that they had come especially to see me, I also felt a bit embarrassed.<br> <br>Whenever I had a chance between tasks, I studied my boss and the other staff as they made sushi. I would roll up a small cloth, pretend it was sushi rice, and mimic their hand movements. On holidays, I would sometimes ask the boss for the leftover sushi rice so that I could practice. My days off, however, began with making the rounds of people who had ordered deliveries the previous day. I would collect the dishes and check that the money matched the orders. Then I tackled several days&#x2019; worth of laundry. By then, it was usually evening. That was the only free time I had.<br> <br>My boss lived with his wife, his mother, his two sons, and his daughter. Sometimes I was asked to take his youngest son to kindergarten or to pick him up afterwards. On days when the restaurant was closed, the boss&#x2019;s family would prepare their dinner in the evening. I remember seeing them sitting around the table enjoying a meal of sukiyaki, but my coworkers and I were not included in that circle. Perhaps I still remember because I envied them. And perhaps I was a bit lonely.<br> <br>On days off, we had a few hours of freedom in the evening after we finished doing all our chores. The other two went drinking, but being underage, I c...</p><h2>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Distant Shores (PFRPG)</h2><p><ul> <li>The Inner Sea region is but a small fraction of the world of Golarion, and it does not stand isolated from the other cultures that call the planet home.

And much more. As Dashiell Hammett closes his final case as a private eye, the details of which will later inspire his most famous book, he acquires at a police auction the bogus object of that case, an obsidian falcon statuette. He casually sets the memento on his desk, where for a decade it bears witness to his literary rise. Until he gives it away. Now, suffering writer&#x2019;s block, the famous author begins to wonder about rumors of the falcon&#x2019;s &#x201c;metaphysical qualities,&#x201d; which link it to a powerful, wish-fulfilling black stone cited in legends from around the world. He can&#x2019;t deny that when he possessed the statuette he wrote one acclaimed book after another, and that without it his fortunes have changed. As his block stretches from months to years, he becomes entangled again with the scam artists from the old case, each still fascinated by the &#x201c;real&#x201d; black bird and its alleged talismanic power. A dangerous maze of events takes Hammett from 1930s San Francisco to the glamorous Hollywood of the 1940s, a federal penitentiary at the time of the McCarthy hearings, and finally to a fateful meeting on New Year&#x2019;s Eve, 1959, at a Long Island estate. There the dying Hammett confronts a woman from his past who proves to be his most formidable rival. And his last hope.</p><p>I have always been intrigued by the seams where fact meets myth and, even more, by the dynamic exchange between the two, which is sometimes strong enough to rip such seams apart, leaving us unable to discern where one ends and the other begins.&nbsp; That the great mystery writer Dashiell Hammett actually worked in his early twenties as a private detective presents obvious opportunities for such exploration.&nbsp; However, it was not until I came upon the following Hammett quote in a 1934 edition of the New York Evening Journal that I conceived a truly original way into his story: "All of my characters are real.&nbsp; They are based directly on people I knew, or came across."&nbsp; This put me in mind of his classic novel <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>, which I admire not only for its craft but also for the audacious revelation at its conclusion that the sought after black bird was still <i>out there</i>.&nbsp; So I wondered: who had been the "real life" models for the Fat Man, Joel Cairo, and Bridget O'Shaughnessy, all of whom must have known Samuel Dashiell Hammett in his P.I. days and may have drifted in and out of his life thereafter, witnessing his transition from gumshoe to bestselling novelist to blocked writer? And, if <i>they</i> were real, might the young Hammett have actually worked a case involving a black statuette, the mysterious nature of which exceeded even the fictionalized jeweled version in his famous novel?&nbsp; And, finally, might that "real" statuette have haunted Dashiell Hammett in unexpected ways long after he achieved fame and fortune, its presence covertly tangled among the known elements of his celebrated and dramatic life? Good questions.&nbsp; So I wrote <i>Hammett Unwritten</i> to find the answers.Owen Fitzstephen is a practitioner of what Dashiell Hammett called "the literary grift".<br><br>Gordon McAlpine is the author of numerous novels.</p><h2>Christmas in My Heart 10</h2><p>Christmas in My Heart 10 [Paperback] [Jan 01, 2008] Wheeler PH.D.

On that fateful day two friends became mortal enemies in a mighty clash of wills that rocked a nation. In FRAGILE PARADISE, the great-great-great-great-grandson of the Bounty mutineer brings to life a fascinating and complex character history has portrayed as both hero and villain, and the real story behind a mutiny that continues to divide opinion more than 200 years later. The result is a brilliant and compelling historical detective story, full of intrigue, jealousy, revenge and adventure on the high seas.

Whether one thinks of Augustine&#39;s coversion in the fourth century, Luther&#39;s recovery of justification by faith in the sixteenth or Barth&#39;s challenge to recover theological exegesis of the Bible in the twentieth, Romans has been the catalyst to personal spiritual renewal and the recapturing of gospel basics. Paul, in seeking to bring unity and understanding between Jews and Gentiles in Rome, sets forth in Romans his most profound explication of his gospel and its meaning for the church. The letter&#39;s relevance is as great today as it was in the first century. In Grant R. Osborne&#39;s careful study of Romans, readers will find an introduction that sets the letter in context and surveys its general content, highlighting issues surrounding its authorship, date, occasion and purpose. Passage-by-passage commentary follows that explains what the letter means to us today as well as what it meant for its original hearers. Students, pastors, Bible teachers and everyone who wants to understand Paul&#39;s message for the church will benefit from this excellent resource.</p><p>Grant R. Osborne (Ph.D., University of Aberdeen) is professor of New Testament at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois. He also serves as series editor for the IVP New Testament Commentary Series, for which he contributed the volume on Romans.

This alphabet procession, however, is somewhat uninspired--many of the representative images will be familiar to browsers of the overflowing shelves of abecedarian books. There are intriguing twists here, though, that raise several entries above the commonplace: the ice cream cone and the old-fashioned telephone have legs, the zoo rides on a float (to enable them to take part in the parade). Other pictures may confuse youngsters: children just learning their ABC's might not realize that the instrumentalists on the J spread are part of a jazz band, or that R 's football player is a receiver . (A word list at the end of the book helps.) Youngsters should enjoy relating the spectators--in a horizontal row at the bottom of each spread--to particular letters, as a goose and a gaucho watch the G section and pet owners hold a koala and kitten up to enjoy the K group. All in all, this may be more of a treat for Chwast's adult fans than for the ABC crowd. Ages 4-7. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Kindergarten-Grade 3-- A festive, colorful, and offbeat alphabetical parade romps through and off the pages of this wordless book. Spectators, pictured in the foreground, hold appropriate props or do something inspired by the letter passing before them. The featured letter is incorporated into the page design that is filled with both usual and unique paraders. A listing of pictured items is appended, although it's not complete; young eyes may discover more in this book not unlike Handford's Where's Waldo? (Little, 1987), but less cluttered and not as garishly hued. A clever volume that may stimulate discussion. --Maria B.

See how questions can act like &#34;pebbles in our shoes&#34; that rumble around in our heads until we get the right answer. Jesus used questions to bring His disciples, the religious leaders of Israel, and the people face to face with their convictions and truth. We can use questions today as powerful tools to address the issues of our culture, the realiability of truth, the love of God, repentance from sin, and the gospel of salvation. Perfect for a Sunday school class or small group discussion, this book includes 11 weeks of questions for any sized group.</p><p>Mark Cahill has a business degree from Auburn University, where he was an honorable mention Academic All-American in basketball. He worked in the business world at IBM and in various management positions and taught high school for four years. Mark now speaks to thousands of people a year at conferences, camps, retreats, etc. He has also appeared on numerous radio and television shows. Mark&#x2019;s favorite thing to do is to have conversations with people to find out what they believe and why they believe it. You can find Mark at malls, concerts, art and music festivals, airports, beaches, sporting events, bar sections of towns, college campuses, etc., doing just that.&#x201c;Wow! These challenging questions that Mark Cahill pitches to believers in Jesus Christ are like fast balls over the plate. I was both seriously engaged and encouraged as Mark presented his thoughts about evangelism, which are drawn from his studies of Jesus&#x2019;s interactions with the religious leaders, His disciples, and the common people during His world-changing ministry on Earth. Mark is a seasoned veteran at sharing the Gospel, and like a coach, he has a heart to train and strengthen fellow believers to reach the people around them for Jesus Christ. Mark&#x2019;s book is a real-world playbook to equip us for big league evangelism. We gotta hustle! Time is short!&#x201d; (Cindy Heydinger)<br><br>&#x201c;This is Mark Cahill&#x2019;s best book yet! It can motivate anyone of any age to witness to others. The stimulating questions throughout leave you thinking hard about how you are living your life. In Mark&#x2019;s inimitable and conversational style, the reader learns true-life evangelism by taking their cues from the way Jesus himself interacted with the lost and the religiously proud. This book is one you don&#x2019;t want to miss.&#x201d; (Dennis Higley)<br><br>&#x201c;This book demonstrates exactly how evangelism should be done&#x2015;with the civility of asking questions! It&#x2019;s amazing how simple questions can become a powerful tool that opens the door to giving others truth. As Mark says, &#x2018;People have to think about eternal matters before they can be saved.&#x2019; How simple it is to ask, &#x2018;Why do you believe what you believe?&#x2019; Asking questions takes all the pressure off of talking to others. I&#x2019;m hoping my simple questions will become &#x2018;pebbles in the shoes&#x2019; of the people I meet! Read this book!

Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate. Frances Hodgson Burnett creates characters so strong and distinct, young readers continue to identify with them even 85 years after they were conceived. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>What secrets lie behind the doors at Misselthwaite Manor? Recently arrived at her uncle's estate, orphaned Mary Lennox is spoiled, sickly, and certain she won't enjoy living there. Then she discovers the arched doorway into an overgrown garden, shut up since the death of her aunt ten years earlier. Mary soon begins transforming it into a thing of beauty--unaware that she is changing too.<p></p><p>But Misselthwaite hides another secret, as Mary discovers one night. High in a dark room, away from the rest of the house, lies her young cousin, Colin, who believes he is an incurable invalid, destined to die young. His tantrums are so frightful, no one can reason with him. If only, Mary hopes, she can get Colin to love the secret garden as much as she does, its magic will work wonders on him.</p></p><h2>The New Healing Herbs: The Classic Guide to Nature&#39;s Best Medicines Featuring the Top 100 Time-Tested Herbs</h2><p><p>An Essential Update of the Classic Herb Reference With Over 1 Million Copies in Print!</p><p>A decade ago, <i>The Healing Herbs</i> set the standard for consumer guides to herbal medicine.

F, Seventh Wisconsin Infantry</h2><p>The recently discovered journal of William Ray of the Seventh Wisconsin is the most important primary source ever of soldier life in one of the war&#39;s most famous fighting organizations. No other collection of letters or diaries comes close to it.Two days before his regiment left Wisconsin in 1861, the twenty-three-year-old blacksmith began, as he described it, &#34;to keep account&#34; of his life in what became the &#34;Iron Brigade of the West.&#34; Ray&#39;s journal encompasses all aspects of the enlisted man&#39;s life-the battles, the hardships, the comradeship. And Ray saw most of the war from the front rank. He was wounded at Second Bull Run, again at Gettysburg, and yet a third time in the hell of the Wilderness. He penned something in his journal almost every day-occasionally just a few lines, at other times thousands of words. Ray&#39;s candid assessments of officers and strategy, his vivid descriptions of marches and the fighting, and his evocative tales of foraging and daily army life fill a large gap in the historical record and give an unforgettable soldier&#39;s-eye view of the Civil War.</p><p>Lance J.

Previously, IFSTA published two separate manuals with student and instructor support materials: Pumping Apparatus Driver/Operator Handbook and Aerial Apparatus Driver/Operator Handbook. Fire departments with both types of apparatus needed two manuals, two curriculum and driver/operator trainees needed two exam preps to study for tests. The release of the 3rd edition of these manuals streamlines the IFSTA training resources. The Pumping Apparatus Driver/Operator Handbook, 3rd Edition covers pumping apparatus only, the second book in the pair, Pumping and Aerial Apparatus Driver/Operator Handbook, 3rd Edition contains the same 15 chapters as the pumping apparatus textbook, plus an additional 5 chapters relevant to aerial apparatus. Personnel on departments that operate both types of apparatus now only need one manual and one curriculum for training. Students only need one exam prep to prepare for testing. If a fire department does not use aerial apparatus, they use the Pumping Apparatus Driver/Operator Handbook, 3rd Edition and omit the aerial sections of the curriculum and exam prep which include all 20 chapters. Chapters 2 and 3 are especially beneficial for all driver/operators: Inspection and Maintenance and Safety and Operating Emergency Vehicles.

The author of many literary novels and stories in practically every genre, his novels have won and been shortlisted for numerous awards including the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, Whitbread and Guardian Fiction Prize. In 1999, he was given the World Fantasy Life Achievement Award; in 2001, he was inducted into the SF Hall of Fame; and in 2007, he was named a SFWA Grandmaster. Michael Moorcock is also a musician who has performed since the seventies with his own band, the Deep Fix; and, as a member of the prog rock band, Hawkwind, won a gold disc. His tenure as editor of New Worlds magazine in the sixties and seventies is seen as the high watermark of SF editorship in the UK, and was crucial in the development of the SF New Wave. Michael Moorcock&#39;s literary creations include Hawkmoon, Corum, Von Bek, Jerry Cornelius and, of course, his most famous character, Elric. He has been compared to, among others, Balzac, Dumas, Dickens, James Joyce, Ian Fleming, J.R.R. Tolkien and Robert E. Howard. Although born in London, he now splits his time between homes in Texas and Paris.</p><h2>Pet Shop of Horrors, Vol. 7</h2><p>Each volume collects four stories of terror and wonder centering around Count D&#39;s Pet Shop, where the mysterious count sells magical creatures who come with a contract whose terms must not be broken.</p><p></p><h2>One Week As Lovers</h2><p><b>Some Pleasures, Once Tasted. . .</b><br><br>Even after finding his betrothed in the arms of another man, Nicholas, the Viscount Lancaster, knows he must wed.

Don't miss this book!" --Eloisa James, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author</p><p></p><h2>The Communist and the Communist&#39;s Daughter: A Memoir</h2><p>In a letter to his baby grandson, Bill Lazarre wrote that "unfortunately, despite the attempts by your grandpa and many others to present you with a better world, we were not very successful." Born in 1902 amid the pogroms in Eastern Europe, Lazarre dedicated his life to working for economic equality, racial justice, workers' rights, and a more just world. He was also dedicated to his family, especially his daughters, whom he raised as a single father following his wife&#x2019;s death. In <i>The Communist and the Communist's Daughter</i> Jane Lazarre weaves memories of her father with documentary materials&#x2014;such as his massive FBI file&#x2014;to tell her father's fascinating history as a communist, a Jew, and a husband, father, and grandfather.<br><br> Soon after immigrating to the United States as a young man, Lazarre began a long career as a radical activist, being convicted of sedition, holding leadership positions in the American Communist Party, fighting in the Spanish Civil War, organizing labor unions, testifying in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee, and resisting the FBI&#x2019;s efforts to recruit him as an informant. Through periods of heroism and deep despair Lazarre never abandoned his ideals or his sustained faith in the fundamental goodness of people.<br><br> This is also the story of Jane as she grew up, married an African American civil rights activist, and became a mother and a writer while coming to terms with her father&#x2019;s legacy. She recounts her arguments with her father over ideology, but also his profound influence on her life. Throughout this poignant and beautifully written work, Jane examines memory, grief, love, and conscience while detailing the sacrifices, humanity, and unwavering convictions of a man who worked tirelessly to create a brighter future for us all.</p><p>Jane Lazarre is the author of numerous works of fiction and nonfiction, including the memoirs <i>Beyond the Whiteness of Whiteness: Memoir of a White Mother of Black Sons</i>, <i>Wet Earth and Dreams: A Narrative of Grief and Recovery</i>, and <i>The Mother Knot</i>, all also published by Duke University Press, as well as the novels <i>Inheritance</i> and <i>Some Place Quite Unknown</i>. She has won awards for her fiction from the National Endowment for the Arts&nbsp;and the New York Foundation for the Arts. Lazarre founded and directed the undergraduate writing program at Eugene Lang College at the New School for ten years and taught creative writing and literature there for twenty years. She has also taught at the City College of New York and Yale University. Lazarre lives in New York City.&#x201c;I found this an intriguing, clear-eyed look at a corner of history, the Communist experience in America, that is usually just righteously condemned&#x2014;or, occasionally, romanticized. Jane Lazarre&#x2019;s vision of it is more subtle: she lived in this world as a child, and now looks back on it as a thoughtful adult.&#x201d; (Adam Hochschild)<br><br>"Reading Jane Lazarre's beautifully written memoir I was quickly drawn into her Jewish, immigrant left-wing family life. The story is filled with longings for the old world of Kishinev and the dreams for a perfected new world of justice and equality. The daughter writes of her father as a veteran of the Spanish Civil War, a single father pursued by the FBI, and called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. She brings to life their love and conflicts and his few years as a proud grandfather. She conveys the rich mixture of Yiddish language and Jewish history, the old world superstitions, the beauty and camaraderie of life in Greenwich Village of the 1950s, and centrally the deep love between a father and daughter. Her father's idealism and values are today central to the lives of her adult African American sons." (Rabbi Rachel Cowan, former director of the Institute for Jewish Spirituality)<br><br>"This extraordinary memoir captures the crazy, scary, intellectually heady experience of growing up with a single father who's a true believer and a daring Communist activist. You need not have lived through the Red Scare to appreciate the impact of deeply held politics on the dynamics of family life, the contemporary relevance of Jane Lazarre's personal story, and the lyrical grace with which she tells it." (Letty Cottin Pogrebin, author of <i>Single Jewish Male Seeking Soul Mate, and a founding editor of Ms. magazine</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Here, in these beautifully written pages, Jane Lazarre&nbsp;invites readers to join her on a difficult journey through memory, history, family, and self-discovery. This daughter's story of her father yields insight into our own, never-ending&nbsp;quest for love, justice, and understanding.&#x201d; (Farah Jasmine Griffin)</p><h2>Thomas Gainsborough: A Country Life</h2><p>This new study on Thomas Gainsborough concentrates on the early life and works of the great eighteenth-century artist. Gainsborough&#x2019;s talent was evident at a young age, and before he established himself as one of London&#x2019;s leading portrait artists he was able to indulge himself in his true passion, landscapes, as well as providing portraits for a provincial clientele. <p>Graced with the light and gentle shadows of the English countryside, these early works provided the foundation for much of Gainsborough&#x2019;s later work. But many of them, including the renowned Mr. and Mrs. Andrews, and His Daughters Chasing a Butterfly, can be called masterpieces in their own right. It was in Suffolk that the artist developed a naturalistic approach to portraiture by abandoning "conversation pieces" and painting instead a number of straightforward head-and-shoulder portraits. This lively and accessible volume features eighty color and black-and-white reproductions of Gainsborough&#x2019;s paintings, etchings, and drawings. They not only shed light on the development of one of England&#x2019;s most revered painters, but also offer an intimate look at the work of a young painter in the thrall of his subjects, and just beginning to realize his full talents.</p></p><p>Thomas Gainsborough (1727-1788) studied art in London, where he later moved and became a favorite painter of the Royal Family. His work was influenced by Dutch landscape painting, van Dyck and Rubens, but his landscapes, portraits and fancy pictures show the work of an independent and original genius.Hugh Belsey is a leading authority on the work of Thomas Gainsborough. He is curator of Gainsborough&#x2019;s House in Sudbury, Suffolk, England, the artist&#x2019;s birthplace and the museum which displays more of his paintings, drawings, and prints than any other.</p><h2>The Book of Mercy</h2><p><i>The Book of Mercy</i> is the story of Edmund Mueller, a retired fireman tormented by memories of his flamboyant wife, Fanny, and her disappearance from his life years ago. Suffering from isolation, Edmund become fascinated with the art of alchemy, with the works of Paracelsus and Hermes Trismegistus, and the search for the Elixir of Life, which will enable him, he believes, to transmute base metals into gold. The cause of his obsession is a harrowing mystery plumbed by his daughter, Anne, and the resident tending him during his institutionalization. <br>Interwoven with Edmund&#x2019;s tale of that of his daughter. Abandoned by her mother while still a baby, Anne learns to take shreds of love where she find them, from her burdened brother and distant father, then from the string of lovers she pursues. She counts on her wits and willfulness to lead her through her unexamined life. It is only when she takes up psychiatry and tries to find the heart to deal with her troubled patients that she begins to know herself and comes to understand that her life, like her father&#x2019;s, has been a search for magic&#x2014;a quest for the transforming power of love.<br></p><p>Narrated in alternate chapters by Edmund Mueller and his daughter, Anne, <i>The Book of Mercy</i> weaves a small web of enchanting tales. There's the story of Edmund's childhood, his marriage to a woman named Fanny who left unexpectedly after their second child, and Edmund's futile retreat into the world of magical arts. Then there's Anne, who leaves to study psychiatry, and her brother, a missionary in the Third World. They are bound together by Kathleen Cambor's elegant hand and graceful eye, and by the novel's arching themes of forgiveness and renewal.<p>Kathleen Cambor is the author of <i>The Book of Mercy,</i> which was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Prize and was awarded the Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize for Excellence in Fiction by an American Woman. For her work on <i>In Sunlight, in a Beautiful Garden,</i> she was awarded the 2001 Guggenheim Fellowship. From 1997 until the end of 2000, she directed the Creative Writing Program at the University of Houston.

Captain Arthur Hastings is well-known as Poirot&#39;s trusty sidekick, the perfect foil for the great detective and his &#39;little grey cells&#39;. Yet although Agatha Christie wrote 33 novels about her famous detective, only eight of them actually feature Captain Hastings. Considered by many to be some of the very best Christie stories, the distinctive Hastings novels are distinguished by being recounted in the first person, just as Dr Watson wrote for Holmes. This omnibus volume brings together the first four Poirot and Hastings novels, including the very first book, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, the international adventures The Murder on the Links and The Big Four, and the ingenious Cornish mystery Peril at End House.</p><p>Agatha Christie was born in Torquay in 1890 and became, quite simply, the best-selling novelist in history. Her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, written towards the end of the First World War, introduced us to Hercule Poirot, who was to become the most popular detective in crime fiction since Sherlock Holmes. She is known throughout the world as the Queen of Crime. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language and another billion in over 100 foreign languages. She is the author of 80 crime novels and short story collections, 19 plays, and six novels under the name of Mary Westmacott.&#39;The actual solution is quite unusually ingenious.&#39; Times Literary Supplement &#39;Agatha Christie never lets you down.&#39; The Sketch</p><h2>The Mango Tooth</h2><p>Posy loses four teeth--and profits from each loss.</p><p></p><h2>Django</h2><p>Born into a travelling gypsy family, young Django Reinhardt taught himself guitar at an early age.

These genius innovators in haute couture commissioned Mike Figgis to portray Moss in her first acting role, resulting in four unique online films: <i>Shadows</i>, <i>Scale</i>, <i>Exhibitionist,</i> and <i>Narcissus</i>&#x2014;<i>The Four Dreams of Miss X</i>. Shot in night vision, these films are intensely intimate: a beautiful woman's private dream experiences. Each film was released online periodically over the last year. Enticing readers into the dusky world of Miss X, the book presents both the scripts and stunning images from the films, as well as a unique DVD featuring all four dreams. This is a must-have purchase for fans of Kate Moss, film, and gorgeous photography.</p></p><p><p>Joseph Corr� (son of Vivien Westwood and Malcolm McLaren) and wife Serena Rees opened the first Agent Provocateur shop 10 years ago arousing a media frenzy usually reserved for superstars. After this phenomenal success, Agent Provocateur has gone on to launch a thriving mail order catalog, an award-winning website, and produce complementary accessories including shoes, jewelry, and a very successful fragrance and beauty line. Kate Moss is one of the most beautiful and arguably the most famous model in the world today. Discovered at JFK airport in 1988, she has since gained icon status worldwide. Mike Figgis is a renowned film director, best known for <i>Leaving Las Vegas </i>and <i>Time Code</i>.</p>A new photo book featuring Kate Moss romping in filmy lingerie by global retailer Agent Provacateur (AP), originally of the UK, proves that the line between art and advertising is thinner than a G-string. The tome, along with an enclosed DVD, is the brainchild of film director Figgis (Academy Award winner for Leaving Las Vegas), who uses four hallucinogenic dream sequences to showcase the diaphanous undergarments that have made AP a fashion favorite. Moss's own introduction explains how pleased she is with the "eerie atmosphere that is reflected in the photographs," but the volume's wealth of sexy, arresting images make it hard to focus on the style icon's introduction, much less the nonsensical text scattered throughout. While some of the photography hits kinky, ethereal, Brassa?-like notes-most notably in the use of oddly realistic, carefully posed mannequins-the majority exhibit a playfully sexy tone, with a few half-hearted stabs at genuine provocation (a woman with a gun pointed at her, a "murder victim" outlined in chalk); less successful are a smattering of heavily pixilated digital stills seemingly meant to evoke arthouse grit. Though Moss is at her sensual best, lesser-known models hold their own-their lack of celebrity baggage lets the expensive lingerie shine, proving itself an art form that's equal parts cutting-edge fashion design and delicious excess. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Many of these maps have never been published, studied, or even viewed by the general public.<br><br>The widespread dispersal of these original maps has made effective, comparitive research virtually impossible without an extraordinary large library. It is also clear that most maps of the battle have received only cursory study by scholars and researchers. DRAWING BATTLE LINES provides a primary resource for all those interested in discussing the visual testimony of the Battle of the Little Bighorn found in these maps.<br><br>Unfortunately, maps of the battle have historically played a subordinate role to the written or oral interviews. Many who fought in the Custer fight, as well as interviewers of the participants, realized the universal art of drawing could clarify information otherwise cluttered by language, interpretation and cultural differences. This book combines both the visual and the historical, and here, a picture is worth a thousand words.<br><br>Michael Donahue has organized these drawings chronologically in each section: Soldier, Warrior, Civilian and Miscellaneous. Included is each map maker's portrait (when available) and a brief biography, understanding that these were people with individual stories and perspectives. The author has carefully analyzed each map providing a summary of its critical values and flaws, using only the original maps and sketches created by eyewitnesses or second generation researchers who interviewed battle participants.<br><br>While this book might seem a cartographer's delight, it is intended to create a historically accurate and visual study guide.

A native of Texas, he holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in History and Art from Stephen F. Austin State University as well as Masters and Masters of Fine Art degrees in Art. His painting Souvenirs of the Little Bighorn was the first artwork to represent the battlefield in the nationally competitive Arts for the Parks exhibition. In 1993, he was recognized as a Piper Professor, one of the top ten professors from all Texas colleges and universities. Donahue&#39;s interest in the Battle of the Little Bighorn began during high school, and he has had numerous articles and artworks published on the battle. He serves on the editorial board of Greasy Grass, a publication that deals exclusively with this subject. He has worked as a seasonal historical interpreter and park ranger at Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument for eighteen summers. Michael Donahue currently lives in Belton, Texas.A splendid example of the fruits of combining research in indoor and outdoor archives. For eighteen summers at the battlefield, Donahue gathered and pondered a variety of formerly unknown maps and took them to the field, sometimes by horseback, to apply their clues to the terrain itself. In this impressively designed volume, he combines reproductions of the maps with his own well-informed analysis of each. The result is a milestone in the historiography of the Little Bighorn. --Robert Utley</p><h2>Origins of the French revolution</h2><p>This revised edition, first published in 1980, when it attempted to construct a new account of the origins of the French Revolution, draws on the important work that has appeared since.

But what is Moi to do when her engagement falls apart? Can she ever find happiness in a city filled with the distractions of Front Row Girls, dermatologists, premieres, and eyebrow waxes? Is it possible to find love in a town where her friends think that the secret to happiness is getting invited to the Van Cleef and Arpels ber-private sample sale?

Gurdjieff's closest follower, this book offers new insight on his spiritual teachings&#x2014;a way of <i>gnosis </i>or "knowledge of being" passed on from remote antiquity. It is a complete and uniquely authoritative guide to the great teacher's ideas and to his methods for liberating ourselves from the state of "waking sleep" in which most of us live our lives. <br><br>Gurdjieff respected traditional religious practices, which he regarded as falling into three general categories or "ways": the Way of the Fakir, related to mastery of the physical body; the Way of the Monk, based on faith and feeling; and the Way of the Yogi, which focuses on development of the mind. He presented his teaching as a Fourth Way that integrated these three aspects into a single path of self-knowledge. Progress in the Fourth Way comes through conscious effort toward a quality of thinking and feeling that brings a new capacity to see clearly and to love.</p><p>Jeanne de Salzmann (1889&#x2013;1990) was born in France and pursued a career in music, dance, and theater. She met Gurdjieff in 1919 and became his closest pupil. Before his death in 1949, Gurdjieff directed de Salzmann to continue his work worldwide. She founded centers in New York, Paris, London, and Caracas, Venezuela. Madame, as she was called with respect, was an esteemed teacher in her own right, transmitting the Gurdjieff Work and especially his &#x201c;Movements,&#x201d; or sacred dances.&#x201c;A work that offers a long-needed clarification and exploration of what G. I. Gurdjieff called the Fourth Way. Madame de Salzmann&#x2019;s writing style will strike outsiders as having the clarity of reporting and the concentration of poetry. The light she shines is a watershed event in the development of the teaching, and in spiritual search in the West. With the publication of her book, she joins Gurdjieff and other great masters from other times and traditions who have dedicated their lives to bringing the incomparable gift of true consciousness, true love, and true being to the world.&#x201d;&#x2014;Tracy Cochran, <i>Parabola </i>magazine</p><h2>Amazing Bible Story MAZES (I&#39;m Learning the Bible Activity Book)</h2><p><i>Amazing Bible Story Mazes </i>promises hours of adventure for the little ones in your life as they learn about forty-four&nbsp;Bible stories while completing each related maze.

One year ago she overheated in her studio and fainted, causing the premature birth of her son. Since then, she&#39;s given up work, and devoted herself to her husband and children. But then Lock Dixon begs her to provide a glass sculpture for a charity gala night. Claire knows that her family should come first, but overwhelmed by the guilt she feels about his wife&#39;s horrific accident, and unable to ignore the chemistry building between herself and Lock, she just can&#39;t say no. Her decision will call her marriage, her friendships and all her loves - past and present -into question. And as her emotions are pushed to the limit, Claire will be left wondering if her life can ever be pieced back together?</p><p>Elin Hilderbrand lives on Nantucket with her husband and their three young children. She grew up in Collegeville, Pennsylvania, and traveled extensively before settling on Nantucket, which has been the setting for her five previous novels. Hilderbrand is a graduate of Johns Hopkins University and the graduate fiction workshop at the University of Iowa.Hilderbrand's seventh novel delves into the psyche of a guilt-ridden mother/artist who embarks on a self-destructive path. Nantucket glass artist Claire Danner Crispin has pieces in private collections and one in the Whitney, but is overwhelmed with the needs of her husband and four kids (she gave up full-time glassblowing to take care of the family). Her troubles worsen when Daphne, a friend she'd been drinking with, is severely injured in a drunken car wreck. Claire is convinced that Daphne's husband, Lockhart, holds her responsible, so she's surprised when he asks her to co-chair a charity gala and create a new piece of glass art for auction. The plot mushrooms as Claire and Lockhart begin an affair; Claire rethinks her priorities; a slew of gala-related complications arise; and Claire's ex-boyfriend turned rock star comes into play. Hilderbrand keeps a lot of balls in the air, and if she pays too much attention to event-planning minutiae, there are still enough conflicts to keep readers entertained. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Worse, the only one who can understand what Chey has become is the man&#x2013;or wolf&#x2013;who's doomed her to this fate. He also wants to chop her head off with an axe. <br><br>Yet as the line between human and beast blurs, so too does the distinction between hunter and hunted . . . for Chey is more than just the victim she appears to be. But once she's within killing range, she may find that&#x2013;even for a werewolf&#x2013;it's not always easy to go for the jugular.</p><p>DAVID WELLINGTON is the author of <i>23 Hours, Vampire Zero, 99 Coffins, 13 Bullets,</i> and the <i>Monster Island</i> trilogy.1.<br><br>The ground shook, and pine needles fell from the surrounding trees like green rain. Chey grabbed a projecting tree root to steady herself and looked up to see a wall of water come roaring down the defile, straight toward her.<br><br>She barely had time to see it before it hit&#x2014;like the shivering surface of a swimming pool stood up on end. It was white and it roared and when it smacked into her it slapped her face and hands as hard as if she&#x2019;d fallen onto a concrete sidewalk. Ice cold water surged up her nose and her mouth flew open, and then water was in her mouth and choking her, water thick with leaves and pine cones that bashed off her exposed skin like bullets, water full of rocks and tiny pebbles and reeking of fresh silt. Her hand was torn away from the root and her feet went out from under her and she was flying, tumbling, unable to control her limbs. Her back twisted around painfully as the water picked her up and slammed her down again, picked her up and dropped her hard. She felt her foot bounce painfully off a rock she couldn&#x2019;t see&#x2014;she couldn&#x2019;t see anything, couldn&#x2019;t hear anything but the voice of the water. She fought, desperately, to at least keep her head above the surface even as eddies and currents underneath sucked at her and tried to pull her down. She had a sense of incredible speed, as if she were being shot down the defile like a pinball hit by a plunger. She had a sickening, nauseating moment to realize that if her head hit a rock now she would just die&#x2014;she was alone, and no one would be coming to help her&#x2014;<br><br>And then she stopped, with a jerk that made her bones pop and shift inside her skin. The water poured over and around her and she heard a gurgling rasp and she was underwater, unable to breathe. Something was holding her down and she was drowning. With all the strength she had left she pushed upward, arcing her back, fighting the thing that held her. Fighting just to get her head above the water. She crested the surface with a sucking gasp and water flooded into her throat. Her body flailed and she was down again, submerged again. Somehow she fought her way back up.<br><br>White water surged and foamed around Chey&#x2019;s face. She could barely keep her mouth above the freezing torrent. Her hands reached around behind her, desperately trying to find what was holding her down, even as the water rose and she heard bubbles popping in her ears. Her skin burned with the cold and she knew she would be dead in seconds, that she had failed.<br><br>She had not been prepared for this. She thought flash floods were something that happened in the desert, not in the Northwest Territories of the Canadian Arctic. Summer had come to the north, however, and with the strengthening sun trillions of tons of snow had begun to melt. All that runoff had to go somewhere. Chey had been hiking up the narrow defile, trying to get up to a ridge so she could see where she was. She had climbed down into the narrow canyon to get away from a knife-sharp wind. It was rough going, climbing as much with her hands as her feet, but she&#x2019;d been making good progress. Then she&#x2019;d paused because she&#x2019;d thought she&#x2019;d heard something. It was a low whirring sound like a herd of caribou galloping through the trees. She had thought maybe it was an earthquake.<br><br>Now, stuck on something, unable to get free, she tried to look around. The current had dragged her backward across ground she&#x2019;d just covered, pulling her over sharp rocks that tore her parka, smearing her face with grit. She could see nothing but silver, silver bubbles, the silver surface of the water above her.<br><br>Her hands were numb and her fingers kept curling up from the cold as she searched behind herself. Chey begged and pleaded with them to work, to move again. She felt nylon, felt a nylon strap&#x2014;there&#x2014;her pack was snagged on a jagged spur of rock. Fumbling, cursing herself, she slipped the nylon strap free. Instantly the current grabbed her again, pulling her again downward, down into the defile. She grabbed at the first shadow she could find, which turned out to be a willow shrub. Hugging it tight to herself, she coughed and sputtered and pulled air back into her lungs.<br><br>Eventually she had enough strength to pull herself upward, out of the water. It now ran only waist deep. With effort she could wade through it. After the first explosive rush much of the water&#x2019;s force had been spent and she could ford the brand new stream without being sucked under once more. On the far bank she dragged herself up onto cold mud and exposed tree roots and lay there, shivering, for a long time. She had to get dry, she knew. She had to warm herself up. She had fresh clothes and a lighter in her pack. Tinder and firewood would be easy enough to come by.<br><br>Slowly, painfully, she rolled over. She was still soaking wet and freezing. Her skin felt like clammy rubber. Once she warmed up she knew she would be in pain. She would have countless bruises to contend with and maybe even broken bones. It would be better than freezing to death, however. She pulled off her pack and reached for its flap. Unfamiliar scraps of fabric met her fingers.<br><br>The flap was torn in half. The pack itself was little more than a pile of rags. It must have been torn apart by the rocks when she&#x2019;d been dragged by the current. It had protected her back from the same fate, but in the process it had come open and all of her supplies had come out. She shot her head around to look at the stream. Her gear, her dry clothes, her flashlight&#x2014;her food&#x2014;must be spread out over half the Territories, carried hither and yon by the water.<br><br>With shaking fingers she dug through the remains of the pack. There had to be something. Maybe the heavier objects had stayed put. She did find a couple of things. The base of her Coleman stove had been too heavy to wash away, though the fuel and the pots were lost, making it useless. Her cell phone was still sealed in its own compartment. It dribbled water as she held it up but it still chirped happily when she clicked it on.<br><br>She could call for help, she thought. Maybe things had gotten that bad.<br><br>No. She switched off the phone to conserve its battery. Not yet.<br><br>If she called for help now, it might come. She might get airlifted out to safety, to civilization. But then she would never be allowed to come back here, to try again. She would not be able to get what she&#x2019;d come for. She shoved the phone in her pocket. She would need it, later, if she survived long enough.<br><br>The map she&#x2019;d been given by the helicopter pilot was still there, though the water had made the ink run and she could barely read it. The rest of her stuff was gone. Her tent was lost. Her dry clothes were lost. Her weapon was nowhere to be found.<br><br>She spent the last of the daylight searching up and down the steep bank of the new stream. Maybe, just maybe something had washed up on the shore. Just as the moon came up she spied a glint of silver bobbing against a half-submerged log and jumped back into the water to get it. Praying that it was what she thought it was, she grabbed it up with both hands and brought it up to her face. It was the foil pack full of energy bars. Trail food. She started to cry, but she was so hungry she tore one open and ate it instead.<br><br>That night she buried herself under a heap of pine needles and old decaying leaves.<br><br>2.<br><br>In the morning she was itchy and damp and her skin felt like it had been scoured with a wire brush, but she knew that the second she tried to move out of her pile of needles, the real torment would begin.<br><br>She was right. When Chey did finally move her arms and legs and sit up, every muscle in her body felt like it had hardened into stone overnight and now was cracking. The stiffness hurt, really hurt, and she realized how rare it was to feel true pain when you lived in a civilized place. You might stub your toe on your coffee table, or even jam your finger in a car door. But you never felt a river pick you up and bang you against a bunch of jagged rocks until it got bored with you.<br><br>She sat curled around her knees for a while, just breathing.<br><br>Eventually she managed to get up on her feet. She had to make a decision. North, or south. South meant giving up. Turning her back on what she&#x2019;d come for.<br><br>She checked her compass and headed north.<br><br>After an hour of walking the stiffness started to go away. It was replaced by searing pain that came with every step she took in her water-logged boots, but that she could wince away.<br><br>She kept walking, through the trees, until she thought she might collapse from exhaustion. The sun was still high above the green and yellow branches, but she couldn&#x2019;t take another step. So she sat down. She thought about crying for a while, but decided she didn&#x2019;t have the energy left. So instead she unwrapped one of her protein bars and ate it. When she was done she got back up and started walking again, because there was nothing else to do. Nothing that would help her.<br><br>Time didn&#x2019;t mean much among the trees, because everything looked the same and every step she took seemed exactly like the one before it. But eventually it got dark.<br><br>She kept walking.<br><br>Until she thought she heard something. A footfall on a crust of snow, maybe. Or just the sound of something breathing. Something that wasn&#x2019;t human.<br><br>Keep walking, she told herself. It&#x2019;s more afraid of you than&#x2014;<br><br>She couldn&#x2019;t bring herself to finish that thought without laughing out loud. Which she really didn&#x2019;t want to do.<br><br>She came to a gap in the cover of branches overhead and a little moonlight leaked through, enough that she could look around her. The sky was alive with colors: the aurora borealis burning and raging overhead. She forced herself not to watch it, though&#x2014;she needed to scan the shadows around her, searching for any sign of pursuit.<br><br>She peered and squinted so hard into the gloom that she almost fell, her hands wheeling out in front of her to catch herself, and then she decided she needed to keep an eye on her footing. Buckled by permafrost, the ground refused to lie flat. Instead it bunched up in wrinkles that could snag her ankle if she wasn&#x2019;t careful. The black trees stood up in random directions, at angles to the earth. The ground rose in sharp hillocks and sudden crevasses that hid glinting ice. Chey&#x2019;s feet kept catching on exposed roots and broken rocks. She could barely trust her perceptions anyway, not after what she&#x2019;d been through, with nothing to eat but energy bars, no real sleep, no shelter except the fleece lining of her torn parka.<br><br>There was nothing out there, she told herself. It had just been her half-starved brain playing tricks on her. The forest was empty of life. She hadn&#x2019;t seen so much as a bird or a chipmunk all day. She stopped in her tracks and turned around to look behind her, just to prove to herself she wasn&#x2019;t being followed.<br><br>Between two of the trees a pair of yellow eyes flickered into glowing life, blazing like the reflectors of a pair of flashlights. They caught the fish-belly white moonlight and speared her with it. Froze her in place. Slowly, languorously, the eyes closed again and were gone, like embers flickering out at the bottom of a dead campfire.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, shit,&#x201d; she breathed, and then slammed a hand over her mouth. Underneath the parka she could feel the hair on the back of her arms standing up. Slowly she turned around in a circle. Wolf. That had been a wolf, a timber wolf. She was certain. Were there more of them? Was there a pack nearby?<br><br>She heard them howl then. She&#x2019;d heard dogs howl at the moon before, but not like this. The howling went on and on and on, with new voices jumping in and following, a sound almost mournful in tone. They were talking among themselves and she figured they were telling each other where to find her.<br><br>She lacked the energy to go another step. Her face contracted in a grimace of real terror. Then she dug deeper inside of herself, deeper than she&#x2019;d ever been before, and she ran.<br><br>The trees flashed by her, leaning to the left, the right. The gnarled ground tore at her feet, made her ankles ache and burn. She kept her arms up in front of her&#x2014;despite the half-full moon she could barely see anything, and could easily collide face first with a tree trunk and snap her neck. She knew it was foolish, knew that running was the worst thing she could do. But it was the only thing she could do.<br><br>To her left she saw flickering gold. The eyes again. Was it the same animal? She couldn&#x2019;t tell. The eyes floated alongside her, easily keeping up with her pace. The eyes weren&#x2019;t expending any effort at all. The feet that belonged to those eyes knew this rough land by instinct, could find the perfect footing without even looking. The Northwest Territories belonged to those eyes, those feet. Not to human weakness.<br><br>To her right she heard panting. More than one of them over there, too. It was a pack, a whole pack, and they were testing her. Seeing how fast she could run, how strong she was.<br><br>She was going to die here, as far from civilization as anyone could ever be. She was going to die.<br><br>No. Not quite yet.<br><br>Evolution had given her certain advantages. It had given her hands. Her distant ancestors had used those hands to climb, to escape from predators. She needed to unlearn two million years of civilization in a hurry. Ahead of her a tree stood up from the leaning forest, a big half-dead paper birch with thick limbs starting two meters off the ground. It rose five meters taller than anything around it. She steeled herself, clenched and unclenched her hands a few times, then dashed right at it, her aching feet catching on the loose bark that pulled away like sloughing skin. Her hands reached up and grabbed at thin branches that couldn&#x2019;t possibly hold her weight, twigs really. She shoved herself up the tree, her body, her face pressed as tightly to the trunk as she could get them, until a wave of ripped bark and crystalline snow came boiling across her face. Suddenly she was holding on to a thick branch three meters above the earth. She pulled herself up onto it, grabbed it with her whole body.

Roosevelt and Five Extraordinary Men Took America into the War a nd into the World</h2><p><i><b>The remarkable untold story of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the five extraordinary men he used to pull America into World War II</b></i><br><br>In the dark days between Hitler&#x2019;s invasion of Poland in September 1939 and Japan&#x2019;s attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Franklin D. Roosevelt sent five remarkable men on dramatic and dangerous missions to Europe. The missions were highly unorthodox and they confounded and infuriated diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic. Their importance is little understood to this day. In fact, they were crucial to the course of the Second World War.<br><br>The envoys were magnificent, unforgettable characters. First off the mark was Sumner Welles, the chilly, patrician under secretary of state, later ruined by his sexual misdemeanors, who was dispatched by FDR on a tour of European capitals in the spring of 1940. In summer of that year, after the fall of France, William &#x201c;Wild Bill&#x201d; Donovan&#x2014;war hero and future spymaster&#x2014;visited a lonely United Kingdom at the president&#x2019;s behest to determine whether she could hold out against the Nazis. Donovan&#x2019;s report helped convince FDR that Britain was worth backing.<br><br>After he won an unprecedented third term in November 1940, Roosevelt threw a lifeline to the United Kingdom in the form of Lend-Lease and dispatched three men to help secure it. Harry Hopkins, the frail social worker and presidential confidant, was sent to explain Lend-Lease to Winston Churchill. Averell Harriman, a handsome, ambitious railroad heir, served as FDR&#x2019;s man in London, expediting Lend-Lease aid and romancing Churchill&#x2019;s daughter-in-law. Roosevelt even put to work his rumpled, charismatic opponent in the 1940 presidential election, Wendell Willkie, whose visit lifted British morale and won wary Americans over to the cause. Finally, in the aftermath of Germany&#x2019;s invasion of the Soviet Union, Hopkins returned to London to confer with Churchill and traveled to Moscow to meet with Joseph Stalin. This final mission gave Roosevelt the confidence to bet on the Soviet Union.<br><br>The envoys&#x2019; missions took them into the middle of the war and exposed them to the leading figures of the age. Taken together, they plot the arc of America&#x2019;s trans�formation from a divided and hesitant middle power into the global leader. At the center of everything, of course, was FDR himself, who moved his envoys around the globe with skill and �lan.<br><br>We often think of Harry S. Truman, George Marshall, Dean Acheson, and George F. Kennan as the authors of America&#x2019;s global primacy in the second half of the twentieth century. But all their achievements were enabled by the earlier work of Roosevelt and his representatives, who took the United States into the war and, by defeating domestic isolationists and foreign enemies, into the world. In these two years, America turned. FDR and his envoys were responsible for the turn.

It has shaped the course of human history. Yet historians still cannot say how it really began. How did a first-century Jew called Jesus manage to spark a new religion? <br><br>It is one of the biggest and most profound of all historical mysteries. This extraordinary book finally provides a convincing answer. <br><br>Traditionally, the birth of Christianity has been explained via the miracle of the Resurrection. After Jesus died he was raised from the dead by God and appeared to his disciples, telling them to spread the gospel. Once they saw the Risen Jesus, nothing could shake their belief. Within a few generations Christianity had spread throughout the Middle East and Europe; within a few centuries it had taken over much of the world.<br><br>But historians have been unable to account for Christianity&#x2019;s remarkable success without the Resurrection to spark it. If no one really saw the Risen Jesus, how were his followers convinced that he was their immortal Messiah?<br><br>Art historian Thomas de Wesselow has spent the last seven years deducing the answer to this puzzle, and in doing so he has pieced together an entirely new picture of the birth of Christianity. Reassessing a familiar but misunderstood historical source and reinterpreting many biblical passages, de Wesselow shows that the solution has been staring us in the face for more than a century.<br><br>The Shroud of Turin, widely thought to be a fake, is in fact authentic. And it holds the key to the greatest mystery in human history.</p><p>Thomas de Wesselow is an art historian experienced at tackling &#x201c;unsolvable&#x201d; problems. He studied art history at Edinburgh University and at the Courtauld in London, where he worked successfully on the <i>Guidoriccio </i>Problem, one of the great mysteries of Italian art. Later, he became a Scholar at the British School in Rome, researching an even more complex puzzle, the so-called Assisi Problem. In 2002, he was appointed a Post-Doctoral Research Associate at King&#x2019;s College, Cambridge University. Since 2007 he has been researching the Shroud full-time. He lives in Cambridge."Some people will dismiss [THE SIGN]. Some people will be intrigued by it.

All clues point to Ayane being the logical suspect, but how could she have committed the crime when she was hundreds of miles away? As Tokyo police detective Kusanagi tries to unpick a seemingly unrelated sequence of events he finds himself falling for Ayane. When his judgement becomes dangerously clouded his assistant must call on an old friend for help; it will take a genius to unravel the most spectacular web of deceit they have ever faced...SALVATION OF A SAINT is a magnificently complex and page-turning thriller starring international crime fiction&#39;s most enigmatic sleuth.This is essential reading for all fans of exceptional crime fiction.</p><p>Keigo Higashino was born in Osaka.

The dry soil didn&#x2019;t seem to have dimmed the color of the petals. <i>Not particularly showy flowers, but they&#x2019;re tough,</i> Ayane thought, gazing out onto the veranda through the sliding glass door. <i>I&#x2019;ll have to water them when I get a chance.</i><br>&#x201c;Have you heard a single word I&#x2019;ve said?&#x201d; Yoshitaka asked.<br>She turned around and smiled faintly. &#x201c;Yes, everything. How could I not?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You might try answering more quickly, then.&#x201d; Yoshitaka, lounging on the sofa, uncrossed and recrossed his long legs. In his frequent workouts, he took pains not to put on too much lower-body muscle&#x2014;nothing that would prevent him from wearing the slim-cut dress pants he preferred.<br>&#x201c;I suppose my mind must&#x2019;ve wandered.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh? That&#x2019;s not like you.&#x201d; Her husband raised a single sculpted eyebrow.<br>&#x201c;What you said was surprising, you know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I find that hard to believe. You should be familiar with my life plan by now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Familiar&nbsp;... Maybe so.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What are you trying to say?&#x201d; Yoshitaka leaned back and stretched his arms out along the sofa top, ostentatious in his lack of concern. Ayane wondered if he was acting or if he truly was that nonchalant.<br>She took a breath and stared at his handsome features.<br>&#x201c;Is it such a big deal to you?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&#x201c;Is what a big deal?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Having children.&#x201d;<br>Yoshitaka gave a derisive, wry little smile; he glanced away, then looked back at her. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t been listening to me at all, have you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I <i>have</i> been listening,&#x201d; she said with a glare she hoped he&#x2019;d notice. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m asking.&#x201d;<br>The smile faded from his lips. He nodded slowly. &#x201c;It <i>is</i> a big deal. A very big deal. Essential, even. If we can&#x2019;t have children, there&#x2019;s no point to us being married. Romantic love between a man and a woman always fades with time. People live together in order to build a family. A man and woman get married and become husband and wife. Then they have children and become father and mother. Only then do they become life partners in the true sense of the word. You don&#x2019;t agree?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s all marriage is.&#x201d;<br>Yoshitaka shook his head. &#x201c;I do. I believe it quite strongly and have no intention of changing my mind. Which is to say, I&#x2019;ve no intention of continuing on like this if we can&#x2019;t have children.&#x201d;<br>Ayane pressed her fingers to her temples. She had a headache. She hadn&#x2019;t seen this one coming. &#x201c;Let me get this straight,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need a woman who can&#x2019;t bear your children. So you&#x2019;ll throw me out and switch to someone who can? That&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re telling me?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No need to put it so harshly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re saying!&#x201d;<br>Yoshitaka straightened. He hesitated, frowning slightly, before nodding again. &#x201c;I suppose that from your perspective it would look that way, yes. You have to understand, I take my life plan very seriously. More seriously than anything else.&#x201d;<br>Ayane&#x2019;s lips curled upward, though smiling was the furthest thing from her mind. &#x201c;You like telling people that, don&#x2019;t you? How you take your life plan so seriously. It was one of the first things you said when we met.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What are you so upset about, Ayane? You have everything you ever wanted. If there&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;ve forgotten, just ask. I intend to do everything I can for you. So let&#x2019;s just stop all this fussing, and start thinking about the future. Unless you see some other way forward?&#x201d;<br>Ayane turned to face the wall. Her eyes fell on a meter-wide tapestry hanging there. It had taken her three months to make it; she remembered the material, special ordered direct from a manufacturer in England.<br>She didn&#x2019;t need Yoshitaka to tell her how important children were. She had wanted them herself, desperately. How many times had she dreamed of sitting in a rocking chair, stitching a patchwork quilt, watching her belly grow larger with each passing day? But God, in his mischief, had made that impossible. So she had given up&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t like she&#x2019;d had a choice&#x2014;and resigned herself to living without. She had thought her husband would be okay with that.<br>&#x201c;I know it might seem silly to you, but can I ask one question?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br>Ayane faced him again, taking a deep breath. &#x201c;What about your love for me? Whatever happened to that?&#x201d;<br>Yoshitaka flinched, then gradually his smile returned. &#x201c;My love for you hasn&#x2019;t changed a bit,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I can assure you of that. I <i>do</i> still love you.&#x201d;<br>That was a complete lie, as far as Ayane was concerned. But she smiled and said that was good. She wasn&#x2019;t sure how else to respond.<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d; Yoshitaka stood and headed for the door.<br>Ayane glanced at her dresser, thinking about the white powder hidden in a sealed plastic bag in the bottommost drawer on the right.<br><i>Guess I&#x2019;ll be using that soon,</i> she thought, the last glimmer of hope fading beneath the shadow inside her.<br>As she followed him out the door, she stared at Yoshitaka&#x2019;s back, thinking, <i>I love you more than anything else in this world. That&#x2019;s why your words were like a knife stabbing me in the heart.</i><br><i>That&#x2019;s why you have to die, too.</i><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2008 by Keigo Higashino<br></p><h2>Amber</h2><p>AMBER A Winter Gathering Collection is a wonderful book by Kim Hargreaves.

It is, however, a workmanlike piece of action sf, very much in the mode of its predecessors. It opens with one of the ex-wives of Sid Gomez, partner of series star Jake Cardigan, being kidnapped for stumbling upon the secrets of a new form of Tek that can be transmitted over computer networks and will wipe out the market for Tek chips. Threatened Tek lords are trying to prevent that from happening and classify Gomez, Cardigan, and a whole bunch of their friends and associates as candidates for elimination. This one has a slightly higher-than-usual body count for a Tek opus and a dark though not grim tone; focuses more on Sid, his ex, her friends, and his associates than on Jake Cardigan; and features a splendidly slimy cast of villains, making its setting seem rather like Batman's Gotham City gone into orbit. One customarily gets neither more nor less than straightforward entertainment from a Tek series entry; this book provides more of the same, and that is surely no shame. <i>Roland Green</i>This ninth Tek novel continues the adventures of private detectives Jake Cardigan and his partner, Sid Gomez, as they search for Sid's missing ex-wife. Although set in the year 2122, this thinly disguised detective story has very little sf. The trite dialog and cookie-cutter characters offer nothing new to enliven this pedestrian series.

As she slips off into memories, we experience her days at La Scala, her marriage to Meneghini, and her great doomed love for Aristotle Onassis.

At the height of his fame, Dee was poised to become one of the greats of the Renaissance. Yet he died in poverty and obscurity - his crime was to dabble in magic . Based on Dee&#39;s secret diaries which record in fine detail his experiments with the occult, Woolley&#39;s book is a rich brew of Elizabethan court intrigue, science, intellectual exploration, discovery and misfortune. And it tells the story of one man&#39;s epic but very personal struggle to come to terms with the fundamental dichotomy of the scientific age at the point it arose: the choice between ancient wisdom and modern science as the path to truth.</p><p>Ben Woolley is an author and broadcaster covering both the arts and science.

The son of a former Negro League standout, Bostock began his professional career with the Minnesota Twins in 1975. Two years later, he became one of the first players in major league baseball to cash in on the new era of free agency, signing with the California Angels for more than $2 million&#x2014;one of the richest contracts in sports history at that time. But Bostock&#x2019;s true potential would never be known. On September 23, 1978, Bostock was shot and killed in Gary, Indiana. He was just 27 years old. <br><br>In Lyman Bostock: The Inspiring Life and Tragic Death of a Ballplayer, K. Adam Powell tells the story of Bostock&#x2019;s humble beginnings in Birmingham, Alabama, his coming-of-age in Los Angeles, his involvement in the Black Power movement, his brief yet impactful baseball career, and his senseless murder in 1978. Those who knew Bostock and played alongside him believed he was good enough to win multiple batting titles, and perhaps even make the Hall of Fame some day. More than just a ballplayer, Bostock was known as a stand-out citizen who never forgot where he came from, investing hours of his time giving back to his community, visiting with local youth, and hosting baseball clinics.<br><br>Lyman Bostock captures a remarkable era in professional baseball, an era when ballplayers such as Bostock still engaged closely with their fans even as power shifted from management and owners to the players. Through careful research, exclusive interviews, and rarely-seen photographs, Bostock&#x2019;s life and the times in which he lived are conveyed in intimate detail. For baseball fans of all ages, Lyman Bostock&#x2019;s biography is a poignant and inspiring story of an upcoming star whose life was cut much too short.</p><p>K. Adam Powell is a reporter for the ACC Sports Journal, the ACCSports.com website, and the Mebane Enterprise newspaper. He previously worked for the Rivals.com network, and has covered Final Fours, college bowl games, and numerous NBA and NFL players. Powell is the author of three books, including Border Wars: The First 50 Years of Atlantic Coast Conference Football (Scarecrow, 2004).A very important aspect of this book, shows the reader all of the details leading up to Lymans final moments. The readers get all the details of the who, what, when, why and where of that fateful night. It filled in a lot of the blanks in the story for me and put to rest any doubts of what a stand up guy Lyman Bostock really was from beginning until the end. Powell did a great job of sharing Bostock&#x2019;s story which I feel has been a very overlooked or forgotten subject. His time in both life and baseball were very short, but his impact was much greater beyond his years. Check this book out, I don&#x2019;t think anyone who puts the effort into reading this will regret it.

With a curt nod to a footman, he swept through the double oak doors and into the marble foyer where two more footmen waited with his butler, Finch.<br><br>"Welcome home, your grace," Finch said with a bow.<br><br>Alex tossed his hat to a footman. "Finch," he responded blandly, and handed the butler his leather traveling gloves. Another footman in the silver and blue livery of the Duke of Sutherland stepped forward to divest him of his cloak. "You may inform my mother I have returned. Where shall I find the correspondence?" he asked as he straightened the French cuffs of his silk shirt.<br><br>"The study, your grace."<br><br>Alex nodded and strode swiftly down the marble corridor, his polished Wellingtons clicking softly beneath his determined stride. He did not glance at the new damask wall coverings, nor the dozens of roses displayed on the consoles along the hall. As he crossed the threshold of his study, he shrugged out of his coat, tossed it carelessly to an overstuffed chair of dark green velvet, then strolled to the intricately carved Louis XIV desk in the middle of the large room. "Whiskey," he said to a footman and picked up the correspondence. Settling gracefully into a chair of burgundy Corinthian leather, he sifted through the stack of letters that had accumulated during his two weeks in London. In addition to standard business correspondence, there were a few invitations to social events. Those he tossed aside. His eyes fell upon a missive sealed with the signet of his solicitors in Amsterdam. Ignoring the whiskey the footman placed at his elbow, he tore it open. Scanning the letter quickly, he cursed softly.<br><br><i>Christ,</i> he had more trouble with that blasted trading company! He abruptly crumpled the report of yet another loss and tossed it across the room in the general direction of the fire. As if the rash of recent losses wasn't enough, Britain's tariffs were strangling him. If he actually <i>had</i> cargo, the import taxes were so damn high as to make it almost economically unfeasible.<br><br>Restlessly he stood and picked up his whiskey, dismissing the footman with a terse nod as he crossed to the bank of floor-to-ceiling windows. He stared at the massive green lawn and gazebo at the edge of a lake marking his brother's grave. Alexander Christian, Viscount Bellingham, was not supposed to be the Duke of Sutherland with all the attendant responsibilities of the family fortune. <i>Anthony</i> was supposed to be the duke&#x2013;<i>he</i> was supposed to be the second son with lesser titles and the luxury of time to indulge in the pursuit of worldly adventure.<br><br>Some might argue that he had seen enough adventure to last a lifetime, but he could not agree. When Anthony was very much alive and performing quite nicely as the duke, Alex had been plagued with stifling ennui. When an old family friend had reported the treasures he had found in Africa, Alex had eagerly accepted an invitation to accompany him on a return trip. That experience in the Serengeti Plain had whetted his appetite for raw adventure. Since then, he had traipsed the Himalayas, had sailed to the Orient, and had discovered the wilds of North America.<br><br>It was a lifestyle that suited him well and one for which he still yearned, but a tragic accident on horseback unexpectedly claimed Anthony's life five years ago. He bitterly recalled being abruptly summoned home to find his beloved brother truly dead and himself an instant duke. The change in his responsibility was almost as instantaneous as the change in attitude of those around him&#x2013;old and new acquaintances alike were suddenly scraping their knuckles in front of him. And in addition to coping with his loss he suddenly found himself at the head of a powerful dukedom and a vast fortune. He no longer had the luxury of several months to leisurely explore the world.<br><br>For five years now, he thought wearily, he had been a duke. Five years it had taken to grow accustomed to being <i>the</i> center of attention. Five years to learn the intricacies of the family holdings and accept the enormous responsibilities of being a duke, not the least of which included the production of heirs. At least Anthony had made that part of his responsibility easy enough, and he had, finally, set a wedding date with Lady Marlaine Reese, just as everyone expected him to do.<br><br>Anthony had been promised to Marlaine almost from the moment of her birth. The Christian-Reese family alliance was almost legend. His father Augustus had befriended the young Earl of Whitcomb before either had married, and the two had formed a monopoly of sorts through their partnership in iron manufacture. The Christian-Reese factories had successfully underpriced other factories for the production of cannons, guns, and ironworks during the Peninsular War, making both families obscene profits. The two men were of like minds, and the powerful voting bloc they formed in the House of Lords had further solidified their long-standing friendship. Everyone knew that a Christian-Reese vote on a bill was as good as passing it.<br><br>It was perfectly natural that their children should continue the alliance, and Anthony was quite content to marry Marlaine, even though he was fifteen when she was born. Alex remembered she was always a pretty, affable girl, but she was still in the schoolroom when Anthony died. When she made her debut three years ago, Alex had determined she was as good a solution to his ducal responsibility to produce heirs as he was likely to find. His title required a good business arrangement in a marriage, and Marlaine was definitely that. Moreover, she was trained to be a duke's wife, was pleasant enough, and was a comfortable, quiet companion. As those things went, she would make a good wife, and he had finally offered for her&#x2013;as everyone expected he would do&#x2013;two years ago when she had turned twenty-one.<br><br>The sound of the pocket doors sliding open interrupted his thoughts, and Alex turned.<br><br>"Welcome home, darling." His mother, Hannah, glided into the room, followed by Marlaine on the arm of his younger brother, Arthur.<br><br>Alex crossed the room to greet her. "Thank you, Mother. I hope I find you well?"<br><br>"Of course! A small ache in my back is all I have to complain of," Hannah said with a smile. "And it is not worth mentioning. You should be quite pleased to know that Lord and Lady Whitcomb are visiting Lady Whitcomb's sister in Brighton. As it is such a short drive, I invited Marlaine to visit this weekend."<br><br>"I am quite pleased," Alex said, and kissed Marlaine on the cheek.<br><br>She blushed slightly, shifting her smiling gaze to the carpet. "You look fatigued. Have you been sleeping?" she murmured.<br><br>"I am fine, Marlaine."<br><br>"Are you quite certain? You look as if you have something on your mind," she insisted.<br><br>"It's business." Extending his hand to Arthur in greeting, he added, "East India."<br><br>"What, again? By God, Alex, we should withdraw!"<br><br>Alex chuckled as he sat on a leather couch. Arthur dropped beside him while Hannah took a seat near the hearth. Marlaine picked up Alex's discarded coat and folded it carefully over one arm before joining her there. Alex reported the contents of his correspondence to Arthur, absently playing with his empty whiskey glass. Unnoticed, Marlaine rose from her seat and crossed to Alex's side. "A drink, darling?" she asked softly. He glanced briefly at her as he handed her the glass, and returned his attention to Arthur, who was quite adamantly reviewing the pros and cons of investing in the East India Company. Marlaine returned with a fresh whiskey and handed it to him with a quiet smile.<br><br>From the corner of his eye, Alex watched her as she returned to her seat. He had the brief, blasphemous thought that on occasion, she behaved like a well-trained dog. Sitting prettily with his coat folded across her lap, she smiled softly at the others without breathing a word. In contrast, Hannah sat on the edge of her chair, leaning forward and listening intently to her sons as they spoke of high tariffs and the need for economic reform. Every so often, she would interject her own opinion.<br><br>They talked until Finch appeared and, moving immediately to divest Marlaine of Alex's coat, announced a bath had been drawn for his grace. Alex tossed the last of the whiskey down his throat and stood. "If you will excuse me, Mother. Marlaine," he nodded, and began to stride across the thick carpet. "I assume supper at the usual time?" he asked over his shoulder.<br><br>"Eight o'clock, dear. Lord and Lady Whitcomb will be joining us."<br><br>Alex nodded, and walked out the door, Finch trailing behind.<br>Hannah Christian, the dowager Duchess of Sutherland, peered over the rim of her wineglass at Alex and sighed softly. His handsome face and warm green eyes betrayed no emotion whatsoever. It was silly, she knew, but she had worried about him since the day he had assumed the title. In contrast to Arthur, who enjoyed each day as if it was a new beginning, Alex seemed to take each day too seriously, as if the success of each one was his own private responsibility.<br><br>It was perfectly ridiculous, in her humble opinion. He was a strong and capable leader, with a sharp mind for business details that had enabled him to expand the family's holdings beyond her wildest imaginations. He could manage the family fortune standing on his head and, as his leadership was also highly regarded in the House of Lords, he could be the toast of all London if he so desired. Certainly the <i>ton</i> had tried to make him so. He was one of the most sought-after personages in all of Britain. A young duke, excessively wealthy and exceedingly handsome, his influence was unparalleled among the peerage. Yet he seemed forever bored&#x2013;at times, even anxious. Her gaze shifted to Marlaine sitting on Alex's right, her quiet smile reserved for him alone. Alex hardly seemed to notice her.<br><br>That's what Hannah hated about the whole betrothal. He hardly <i>noticed</i> Marlaine.<br><br>She casually sipped her wine as she contemplated the pretty blond. She had nothing against Marlaine; she was a pleasant, well-bred young woman, the daughter of the affable Earl of Whitcomb, and a very suitable match for a duke. But not her son. Hannah wanted Alex to know the sheer joy of love she and her beloved Augustus had known, that complete adoration one feels for a true soul mate. She wanted her son to marry for love, not for some arcane sense of responsibility. She had hoped that in some dark corner of his soul, Alex might <i>want</i> to love the woman he would marry. That maybe, just maybe, he would realize Marlaine did not strike the chord in him that made him want to move mountains just to please her.<br><br>Alex's gaze met hers across the table, and he very subtly lifted a brow, as if inquiring what she was thinking. Hannah shrugged helplessly. He smiled faintly and shifted his gaze to Arthur, who was relating some outrageous event that had occurred at a rout of the infamous Harrison Green, much to Edwin Reese's considerable amusement. Hannah had noticed that other members of the youthful set hung upon every detail of a Harrison Green affair, but Alex, as usual, looked bored.<br><br>His mother was mistaken&#x2013;Alex was not bored. He was quietly plotting to entice his future father-in-law into supporting a set of reforms sure to make their way out of the House of Commons next Season. Reforms that would lower the sky-high tariffs he was paying on his shipping line.<br><br>When supper was concluded and the women retired to the green salon, Alex, Arthur, and Lord Whitcomb stayed in the dining room for the customary cigar and port. Alex absently watched the hands of the porcelain mantel clock as Arthur and Whitcomb discussed a pair of hunting dogs. Convinced the expensive timepiece was winding down, Alex checked it against his pocket watch.<br><br>"Are we boring you, Sutherland?" Whitcomb grinned. Startled, Alex hastily shoved his pocket watch out of sight.<br><br>"He's smarting over another reported loss from East India," Arthur said, chuckling.<br><br>"That so? Never thought dallying in shipping was the way to go," the elderly earl remarked.<br><br>"It would be quite profitable if the tariffs weren't so damned high," Alex said.<br><br>Whitcomb shrugged. "Those tariffs also keep foreign grain from coming to our shores and competing with what you grow out here, son."<br><br>"Yes, and when the domestic markets are flooded, it keeps the smaller farmer from exporting his grain to the continent."<br><br>Whitcomb chuckled and puffed on his cigar. "Don't know why you'd worry about that. From what I hear, most of them can't afford the labor tax necessary to harvest the grain to begin with. It's not as if they are competing with your exports."<br><br>"My point exactly, Edwin. Competition is healthy. This country is long overdue for economic reform. Taxes are strangling the shipping and agricultural industries&#x2013;the system is antiquated and lacks equity. Just think of the profits you would realize in your factories if the labor tax was equalized across all industries," Alex said calmly, and took a long sip of his port, eyeing his future father-in-law above the rim.<br><br>"Perhaps," Whitcomb said thoughtfully. "Can't deny the countryside suffers worse than the manufacturers. But I don't like the reform package the Radicals are pushing&#x2013;they want to do away with the whole parliamentary system, I fear, and the first step would be allowing the Catholics a seat. Can't have that, you know."<br><br>Alex did not immediately respond. Catholic emancipation was a point of great contention among his peers, but he honestly could not care less if Catholics held a seat in Parliament. "All I know is that we need relief and a new, <i>fair</i> system of taxation. Perhaps next Season we could work together toward a more palatable set of reforms."<br><br>Whitcomb smiled as he drained his port glass. "I might be amenable to that. Always enjoyed a good fight in the Lords. Well, gentlemen, shall we see what the ladies are about?" He did not wait for an answer, but shoved away from the table. Alex and Arthur dutifully followed him to the green salon, where they sat quietly listening to the ladies talk of engagement parties for two hours more.<br><br>Later, as Alex stood in the foyer with his mother, he heard Marlaine mention that she and Lady Whitcomb would return the next day to discuss the winter engagement party. He managed not to snort impatiently.</p><h2>Silvana&#39;s Gluten-Free and Dairy-Free Kitchen: Timeless Favorites Transformed</h2><p><p><b>The founding editor of <i>Every Day with Rachael Ray</i> reinvents America's favorite dishes for a gluten- and dairy-free world &#x2014; no compromises to flavor or texture accepted. </b></p><p><b>&#x201c;The fact that everything she makes is gluten-free is astonishing.&#x201d; &#x2014;</b><i><b>Food &amp; Wine</b></i></p><p>When doctors diagnosed Silvana Nardone&#x2019;s son with intolerances to gluten and dairy, she embarked on a quest to develop dishes for the toughest critics of all: her kids.

These notes are signed by Mara, a female judge, or Brehon, from this era.</i>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>EARLY Summer in the Burren has a glory about it: in the valleys a glory of soft greens, creamy hawthorn blossom and purple foxgloves; on the sparkling limestone of the uplands tiny jewel-like flowers of purple, yellow and blue sprinkled in the grykes between the flat, shining slabs of stone. Orange tip butterflies swoop among the cuckoo flowers, vibrant blue-green dragonflieshaunt the crystal waters of the spring wells and larks soar high above the contented cattle.The sky, on that morning of the eve of <i>Bealtaine,</i> 1509, was a clear bright blue with wisps of bog-cotton clouds drifting slowly across. There had been rain during the night, but the heat of the sun was already strong enough to draw a fine mist from the clints that paved the fields, turning the limestone from blue-black to silver-grey and warming the massive stone walls that enclosed the scholars' house, the farm manager's house, the guest house, the schoolhouse and the kitchen house of the law school of Cahermacnaghten. No one was awake there - no sound of scholars' voices, no clatter of breakfast pans, no clank of the water pump. All was silent except for the excited high vit, vit, veet call of the swallows and the distant lowing of cows, knee-deep in the golden dust of the buttercups.A hundred yards away from the law school was the Brehon's house, a substantial two-storey building of well-cut stone with a wispy plume of aromatic peat smoke drifting from the central chimney. Around the house was a garden of about one acre. From the front door to the gate ran a path of stone flags lined with pots of lilies. A small woodland of hazel trees to the west protected the plants against the strong salt-laden winds from the Atlantic. To the north was a hedge of gleaming dark green holly, tall white flowers growing in its shelter. To the east and the south were low hedges of perfumed lavender and in the centre a gently curving bed crammed with tiny blue gentians twisted and coiled through the garden.In the garden Mara, Brehon of the Burren, was kneeling on the path pulling out weeds from among her gentians. She was a tall woman, still slim despite her thirty-six years of hearty eating, and her raven-black hair, plaited and coiled at the back of her neck, showed no signs of grey. She wore the traditional linen <i>l�ine,</i> a creamy-white tunic which suited her dark hair and herolive skin. Over it she wore a green fitted gown, laced up at the front, its flowing sleeves caught in tightly at the wrist.Mara was an immensely busy woman with responsibility for the law school as well as for maintaining law and order in the stony kingdom of the Burren, so these few moments that she spent every day in her garden in the early morning, or late evening, were very important to her. However, she was also a very sociable person who enjoyed a chat with her neighbours so when footsteps sounded on the stone road that ran between Cahermacnaghten and Baur North, she looked across the wall.'You're out early, Brehon.' The voice was familiar and with a smile of pleasure Mara stood up, abandoning her weeding.'It's a beautiful morning, Diarmuid,' she said.'Yes, it's a beautiful morning, God bless it. The grass is beginning to grow fast now with the strength of the sun. It'll soon be haymaking time.''Would you like a cup of ale?''No, no,' Diarmuid said, shaking his head.Mara said no more, just waited. Diarmuid O'Connor would not be walking along the road past Cahermacnaghten so soon after dawn just to discuss the weather with her. Something else was troubling him.'I was hoping I might see you,' he said eventually, avoiding her eyes.She surveyed him carefully. He was about her own age, a man of medium height and red-blond hair, his skin covered with freckles from daily exposure to the clear skies and the fierce winds of the Atlantic. She had known him since they were both children; she knew him to be trustworthy, a good neighbour, loyal to his clan, to his neighbours and a self-sufficient man. He lived alone on a farm in Baur North, about a mile from Cahermacnaghten.'What's wrong?' she asked.He fidgeted uneasily. She suspected that he would have preferred to go on talking about the weather.'Well, you know there has been a bit of trouble between our kin-group and the MacNamaras?' he asked after a while.'Yes,' she said encouragingly.'Well, my brown cow was missing this morning,' he went on. 'I went to look at her first thing. I thought she might have dropped a calf last night, but she wasn't there.''Was she out in the field overnight, then?' asked Mara.Diarmuid shook his head. 'No,' he said. 'I put her in the little cabin just next to the house last night. I knew I'd hear her there if she was distressed. It's just beside my window. She was shut in securely. There's a latch on the door and there's a bolt on the gate to the yard. This morning I found the door was wide open, and the cow was gone. She was stolen; there's no doubt about it. And I can guess who stole her.'Mara frowned. This was bad news. At best, an uneasy peace existed between the O'Connors and the MacNamaras. Absent-mindedly she dusted the earth from her fingers.'Walk down to the schoolhouse with me, Diarmuid,' she said. Smoke was beginning to drift up from the kitchen house within the law school enclosure and they could hear a few raucous boyish shouts from the scholars' house. The corners of her mouth relaxed; she always enjoyed her scholars; their high spirits and their energy kept her young.'I've disturbed your peace,' said Diarmuid with his usual courtesy.'No, no,' she said as she replaced her small fork in the willow basket beside her and walked towards the gate. Then she frowned again. The shouts were silenced by a scolding, slightly high-pitched, masculine voice. Colman was so stupid, she thought vehemently. Why couldn't he leave them alone? He would have more authority with the boys if he allowed them to indulge ina few high spirits when it didn't matter. Why did I ever take him on as junior master? she asked herself for the hundredth time.'I'll send my assistant Colman to take notes,' she said quickly. 'We'll go and get him now and you can tell him everything. I'll hear the case at today's judgement day.'This will be something for Colman to do this morning, she thought with relief as she walked down the road at Diarmuid's side. Once the young man had finished his studies and graduated from Cahermacnaghten she should have let him go off as a wandering <i>aigne,</i> or advocate lawyer. He was clever; he would have made his way. He would have earned far more than she gave him. It had been weak of her to agree to his suggestion that he do a year's teaching at the law school to broaden his experience before he left. She had been worried about him; that was why she thought another year under her influence would be good for him. Now it seemed that she was forever inventing ways to get him away from the boys for a while, and relieved whenever he absented himself to go to Galway.'You'll come in and have a cup of ale while you're waiting for him, won't you?' she asked Diarmuid when they reached the law school.'Just a <i>doiche an dorus,</i> then.' He followed her through the great iron gate of the law school and into the enclosure. The six law scholars were dashing out of the scholars' house and calling out greetings to her with broad smiles on their faces. They all looked unusually neat and tidy, she noticed, faces shining from soap and water, damp hair showing the ridges of the combs that had been ploughed through the tangles, leather boots shining with polish. The night before Brigid would have put out the clean <i>l�inte,</i> tunics of bleached linen, for them. Today was an important day for the law school of Cahermacnaghten. Today was one of the four big judgement days on the Burren, the eve of <i>Bealtaine.</i>Mara eyed them affectionately. From eighteen-year-oldFachtnan to ten-year-old Shane they were like a family to her, closer in some ways than her two grandchildren in Galway. She noticed with concern that twelve-year-old Hugh looked a little tearful. There was a red mark across one of his cheeks and at that sight her lips tightened in exasperation. She had told Colman again and again that there was no need for him to hit those boys; they were all so motivated to learn and to succeed at the difficult profession of lawyer that a withdrawal of privileges was the only punishment ever necessary. Hugh's mother had died a few months earlier of the sweating sickness, picked up on a visit to the city of Galway, and Hugh had been nervous and anxious ever since. Colman should know that. She would speak to him later, she decided, but she would say nothing in front of the scholars. She could not undermine his authority.'Colman,' she said coldly, 'will you take your breakfast quickly and go with Diarmuid. He has had a cow stolen. Make notes of the case and bring them back to me as quickly as possible so that I may study them before we go to Poulnabrone at noon. Hugh,' she added gently with a smile, 'will you bring our visitor a cup of ale and one of Brigid's oatcakes?''Just a <i>doiche an dorus,'</i> repeated Diarmuid, standing carefully by the heavy wooden door of the kitchen ho...</p><h2>Leviathan</h2><p>When a cyberspace experiment produces a horrifying beast, Jack Connor seeks the aid of a legendary Norseman to help him destroy it</p><p>Cast from the mold of Michael Crichton's cautionary tales about scientific excess but given a Christian glaze, this novel pits one Jackson Connor?whose initials aren't incidental?against a monster created through genetic manipulation. "Electromagnetic chromosomal" means have allowed Dr. Peter Frank to turn a Komodo dragon's DNA into that of a "Leviathan," grown by Stygian Enterprises to sell to the U.S. government as a weapon of war. Things get out of control, allowing Huggins (The Reckoning) to express a virulent disdain for the feds and an only slightly more tempered lack of regard for scientific research. Salvation comes at the hands of Connor, an electrician employed by Stygian on the arctic island where Leviathan is based; he is aided in the good fight by Thor Magnusson, a scholarly giant of a priest hiding from the forces of evil. Huggins is a far from subtle writer, given to preaching and melodrama ("what we have accomplished in this cavern may very well have altered the nature of life as we know it," intones one character), but once the action gets up to steam, he takes readers on a merry, entertaining ride. Whether the book, drenched in apocalyptic Christian theology, will cross over to a secular readership remains to be seen, however. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Angel Chronicles, Volume 1</h2><p>Three stories from the first few episodes of the hit television series follows the star-crossed relationship of Buffy and Angelus, a vampire with a conscience, which begins when Buffy decides not to kill him.

He dropped into the seat beside me and began buttering a piece of toast, as though it had been two hours since I had seen him last, rather than two months.</p> <p>I took a sip of coffee. &#x201c;Hello, Milo. How good of you to drop in.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking well, Amory.&#x201d;</p> <p>I had thought the same of him. His time on the Riviera had obviously served him well. His skin was smooth and golden, setting off the bright blue of his eyes. He was wearing a dark gray suit, lounging in that casual way he had of looking relaxed and at home in expensive and impeccably tailored clothes.</p> <p>&#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t expected to see you back so soon,&#x201d; I said. His last letter, an offhanded attempt at keeping me informed of his whereabouts, had arrived three weeks before and hinted that he would probably not return home until late July.</p> <p>&#x201c;Monte Carlo grew so tedious; I simply had to get away.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;Nothing to replace the dull routine of roulette, champagne, and beautiful women like a rousing jaunt to your country house for toast and coffee with your wife.&#x201d;</p> <p>Without really meaning to do so, I had poured a cup of coffee, two sugars, no milk, and handed it to him.</p> <p>&#x201c;You know, I believe I&#x2019;ve missed you, Amory.&#x201d;</p> <p>He looked me in the eyes then and smiled. Despite myself, I nearly caught my breath. He had that habit of startling, dazzling one with his sudden and complete attention.</p> <p>Grimes, our butler, appeared at the door just then. &#x201c;Someone to see you in the morning room, madam.&#x201d; He did not acknowledge Milo. Grimes, it had long been apparent, was no great admirer of my husband. He treated him with just enough respect that his obvious distaste should not cross the boundary into impropriety.</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you, Grimes. I will go to the morning room directly.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Very good, madam.&#x201d; He disappeared as noiselessly as he had come.</p> <p>The fact that Grimes&#x2019;s announcement had been so vague as to keep Milo in the dark about the identity of my visitor was not lost on my husband. He turned to me and smiled as he buttered a second piece of toast. &#x201c;Have I interrupted a tryst with your secret lover by my unexpected arrival?&#x201d;</p> <p>I set my napkin down and rose. &#x201c;I have no secrets from you, Milo.&#x201d; I turned as I reached the door and flashed his smile back at him. &#x201c;If I had a lover, I would certainly inform you of it.&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>ON MY WAY to the morning room, I stopped at the large gilt mirror in the hallway to be sure the encounter with my wayward husband had not left me looking as askew as I felt. My reflection looked placidly back at me, gray eyes calm, waved dark hair in place, and I was reassured.</p> <p>It took time, I had learned, to prepare myself for Milo. Unfortunately, he did not often oblige me by giving notice of his arrival.</p> <p>I reached the door to the morning room, wondering who my visitor might be. Grimes&#x2019;s mysterious announcement was a reflection of my husband&#x2019;s presence, not the presence of my visitor, so I would have been unsurprised to find as commonplace a guest as my cousin Laurel behind the solid oak door. I entered the room and found myself surprised for the second time that morning.</p> <p>The man seated on the white Louis XVI sofa was not my cousin Laurel. He was, in fact, my former fianc�.</p> <p>&#x201c;Gil.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Hello, Amory.&#x201d; He had risen from his seat as I entered, and we stared at one another.</p> <p>Gilmore Trent and I had known each other for years and had been engaged for all of a month when I had met Milo. The two men could not have been more different. Gil was fair; Milo was dark. Gil was calm and reassuring; Milo was reckless and exciting. Compared with Milo&#x2019;s charming unpredictability, Gil&#x2019;s steadiness had seemed dull. Young fool that I had been, I had chosen illusion over substance. Gil had taken it well and wished me happiness in that sincere way of his, and that was the last that I had seen of him. Until now.</p> <p>&#x201c;How have you been?&#x201d; I asked, moving forward to take his hand. His grip was warm and firm, familiar.</p> <p>&#x201c;Quite well. And you? You look wonderful. Haven&#x2019;t changed a bit.&#x201d; He smiled, eyes crinkling at the corners, and I felt instantly at ease. He was still the same old Gil.</p> <p>I motioned to the sofa. &#x201c;Sit down. Would you care for some tea? Or perhaps breakfast?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, no. Thank you. I realize I have already imposed upon you, dropping in unannounced as I have.&#x201d;</p> <p>A pair of blue silk-upholstered chairs sat across from him, and I sank into one, somehow glad Grimes had chosen the intimate morning room over one of the more ostentatious sitting rooms. &#x201c;Nonsense. I&#x2019;m delighted to see you.&#x201d; I realized that I meant it. It was awfully good to see him. Gil had kept out of society and I had wondered, more than once in the five years since my marriage, what had become of him.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s good to see you too, Amory.&#x201d; He was looking at me attentively, trying to determine, I supposed, how the years had changed me. Despite his claim that I was still the same, I knew the woman before him was quite different from the girl he had once known.</p> <p>Almost without realizing it, I had been appraising him as well. Five years seemed to have altered him very little. Gil was very good-looking in a solid and conventional sort of way, not stunning like Milo but very handsome. He had dark blond hair and well-formed, pleasant features. His eyes were a light, warm brown, with chocolaty flecks drawn out today by his brown tweed suit.</p> <p>&#x201c;I should have written to you before my visit,&#x201d; he went on, &#x201c;but, to tell the truth&nbsp;&#x2026; I wasn&#x2019;t sure you would see me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Why wouldn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d; I smiled, suddenly happy to be sitting here with an old friend, despite what had passed between us. &#x201c;After all, the bad behavior was entirely on my part. I am surprised that you would care to see me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;All water under the bridge.&#x201d; He leaned forward slightly, lending sincerity to his words. &#x201c;I told you at the time, there was no one to blame.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That is kind of you, Gil.&#x201d;</p> <p>He spoke lightly, but his lips twitched up at the corners as though his mouth could not quite decide if he was serious, could not quite support a smile. &#x201c;Yes. Well, one can&#x2019;t stop love, can one?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; My smile faded. &#x201c;One can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p> <p>He leaned back in his seat then, dismissing the intimacy of the moment. &#x201c;How is Milo?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s very well. He returned only this morning from the Riviera.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, I had read something about his being in Monte Carlo in the society columns.&#x201d; I could only imagine what it might have been. Within six months of my marriage, I had learned it was better not to know what the society columns said about Milo.</p> <p>For just a moment, the specter of my husband hung between us in the air.</p> <p>I picked up the box of cigarettes on the table and offered one to him, knowing he didn&#x2019;t smoke. To my surprise, he accepted, pulling a lighter from his pocket. He touched the flame to the tip of his cigarette and inhaled deeply.</p> <p>&#x201c;What have you been doing these past few years?&#x201d; I asked, immediately wondering if the question was appropriate. It seemed that some shadow of the past tainted nearly every topic. I knew that he had left England for a time after we had parted ways. Perhaps his travel since our parting was not something he wished to discuss. After all, there had been a time when we had traveled together. In the old days, before either of us had ever thought of marriage, our families had often been thrown together on various holidays abroad, and Gil and I had become fast friends and confidants. He had good-naturedly accompanied me in searching out scenic spots or exploring ancient ruins, and our evenings had been occupied by keeping one another company in hotel sitting rooms as our parents frequented foreign nightspots until dawn. Sometimes I still thought fondly of our adventures together and of those long, comfortable conversations before the fire.</p> <p>He blew out a puff of smoke. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve traveled some. Kept busy.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I expect you enjoyed seeing more of the world. Do you remember the time we were in Egypt&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>He sat forward suddenly, grounding out his cigarette in the crystal ashtray on the table. &#x201c;Look here, Amory. I might as well tell you why I&#x2019;ve come.&#x201d;</p> <p>Years of practice in hiding my thoughts allowed me to keep my features from registering surprise at his sudden change of manner. &#x201c;Certainly.&#x201d;</p> <p>He looked me in the eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve come to ask a favor.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Of course, Gil. I&#x2019;d be happy to do anything&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>He held up a hand. &#x201c;Hear me out before you say yes.&#x201d; He was agitated about something, uneasy, so unlike his normally contained self.</p> <p>He stood and walked to the window, gazing out at the green lawn that went on and on before it ended abruptly at the lake that marked the eastern boundary of the property.</p> <p>I waited, knowing it would do little good to press him. Gil wouldn&#x2019;t speak until he was ready. I wondered if perhaps he had come to ask me for money. The Trents were well-off, but the recent economic difficulties had been far-reaching, and more than a few of my friends had found themselves in very reduced circumstances. If that was the case, I would be only too happy to help.</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need money, if that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re thinking,&#x201d; he said, his back still to me.</p> <p>Despite the tension of the situation, I laughed. &#x201c;Still reading my mind.&#x201d;</p> <p>He turned, regarding me with a solemn expression. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not so hard to read your mind, but your eyes are harder to read than they used to be.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Concealment comes with practice,&#x201d; I replied.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, I suppose it does.&#x201d; He walked back to the sofa and sat down.</p> <p>When he spoke, his tone had returned to normal. &#x201c;Have you seen anything of Emmeline these past years?&#x201d;</p> <p>I wondered briefly if he had decided not to ask me the favor, reverting instead to polite conversation. Emmeline was Gil&#x2019;s sister. She was younger than me by three years and away at school in France during much of our acquaintance, but we had been friends. After my engagement to Gil had ended, however, Emmeline and I had drifted apart.</p> <p>&#x201c;Once or twice at London affairs,&#x201d; I answered.</p> <p>&#x201c;Was she&nbsp;&#x2026; do you remember the chap she was with?&#x201d;</p> <p>I cast my mind back to the last society dinner at which I had seen Emmeline Trent. There had been a young man, handsome and charming, if I recalled correctly. Something about my memory of him nagged at me, and I tried to recall what it was.</p> <p>&#x201c;I remember him,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;His name was Rupert something or other.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Rupert Howe, yes. She plans to marry him.&#x201d;</p> <p>I said nothing. There was more to come; that much was certain.</p> <p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not a good sort, Amory. I&#x2019;m sure of it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That may be, Gil,&#x201d; I said gently. &#x201c;But, after all, Emmeline is a grown woman.&#x201d; Emmeline would be twenty-three now, older than I had been when I married.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like that, Amory. It isn&#x2019;t just that I don&#x2019;t like the fellow. It&#x2019;s that I don&#x2019;t trust him. There&#x2019;s something&nbsp;&#x2026; I don&#x2019;t know&#x2026;&#x201d; His voice trailed off, and he looked up at me. &#x201c;Emmeline has always liked you, looked up to you. I thought that, perhaps&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>Was this why he had come? I had no influence on Emmeline. &#x201c;If she won&#x2019;t listen to you,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;whatever makes you think she will care what I have to say?&#x201d;</p> <p>He paused, and I could see that he was formulating his words, planning out what he would say. Gil had always been like that, careful to think before speaking. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a large party going down to the south coast, a little village outside Brighton, tomorrow. Emmeline and Rupert and several other people I&#x2019;m sure you know. We&#x2019;ll be staying at the Brightwell Hotel for a week. I came to ask you if you would go on the pretext of a holiday.&#x201d;</p> <p>I was surprised at the invitation. I had not seen Gil in five years, and suddenly here he was, asking me to take a trip to the seaside. &#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t understand. What can I do, Gil? Why come to me?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&nbsp;&#x2026; Amory,&#x201d; his eyes came up to mine, the brown flecks darker than they had been. &#x201c;I want you to accompany me&nbsp;&#x2026; to appear to be <i>with</i> me. You understand?&#x201d;</p> <p>I did understand him, just as easily as I once had. I saw just what he meant. I was to go with him to the seaside, to give the impression that I had left Milo. That my marriage had been a mistake. Emmeline had seen the society columns, the reports of my husband gallivanting across Europe without me; she would believe it.</p> <p>I suddenly comprehended that there would be good reason for me to talk to Emmeline, how I would have authority when Gil didn&#x2019;t.</p> <p>Gil had said he didn&#x2019;t trust Rupert Howe. I knew he was right. I knew Gil had seen in Rupert the same thing that had caught my attention when I had met him.</p> <p>Emmeline&#x2019;s Rupert had reminded me of Milo.</p> <p>My decision was almost immediate. &#x201c;I should be delighted to come,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I should like to keep Emmeline from making a mistake, if I possibly can.&#x201d;</p> <p>Gil smiled warmly, relief washing across his features, and I found myself returning the smile. The prospect of a week at the seaside in the company of old friends was not an unappealing one, at that.</p> <p>Of course, had I known the mayhem that awaited, I would have been more reluctant to offer my services.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by Ashley Weaver</p></p><h2>My Grammar and I Or Should That Be Me?: How to Speak and Write It Right</h2><p>For anyone who has ever had a problem with dangling modifiers and split infinitives, or for those who have no idea what these things even are, My Grammar and I provides all the answers.

He put down the Wii controller. He was twelve under par with three holes left to play and thus very well on the way to qualifying for the Masters. He was playing Rick Fowler, as he was the only golfer in the Tiger Woods Masters who was cool and anywhere close to his own age, twenty-one. And they both liked Eminem and Rise Against and wearing orange. Of course Rick Fowler could afford his own flat whereas Stian still lived at home. But it was only temporary, until he got a scholarship to go to university in Alaska. All semi-decent downhill skiers went there if they got good results in the Nordic Junior Ski Championship and so on. Of course, no one became a better skier from going there, but so what? Women, wine and skis. What could be better. Perhaps the odd exam if there was time. The qualification could lead to an OK job. Money for his own flat. A life that was better than this, sleeping in the slightly too short bed under posters of Bode Miller and Aksel Lund Svindal, eating Mum&#x2019;s rissoles and obeying Dad&#x2019;s rules, training mouthy brats who according to their snow-blind parents had the talent to be a Kjetil Andr� Aamodt or a Lasse Kjus. Operating the ski lifts in Tryvannskleiva for a wage they wouldn&#x2019;t bloody dare give child workers in India. And that was how Stian knew it was the chairman of the Ski Club on the phone now. He was the only person Stian knew who avoided ringing people on their mobiles because it was a bit more expensive, and who preferred to force them to run downstairs in prehistoric houses that still had landlines.<br><br>Stian took the receiver his mother held out for him.<br><br>"Yes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hi, Stian, Bakken here.&#x201d; Bakken meant slope, and it really was his name. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been told the Kleiva lift&#x2019;s running.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now?&#x201d; Stian said, looking at his watch. 11:15 at night. Closing time was at nine.<br><br>&#x201c;Could you nip up and see what&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Unless you&#x2019;re extremely busy, of course.&#x201d;<br><br>Stian ignored the sarcasm in the chairman&#x2019;s intonation. He knew he&#x2019;d had two disappointing seasons and that the chairman didn&#x2019;t think it was down to lack of talent but to the large amounts of time Stian did his best to fill with general idleness.<br><br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t got a car,&#x201d; Stian said.<br><br>&#x201c;You can use mine,&#x201d; his mother chipped in. She hadn&#x2019;t gone away;<br>she was standing next to him with her arms crossed.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Sorry, Stian, but I heard that,&#x201d; the chairman commented laconically. &#x201c;The Heming skateboarders must have broken in. I suppose they think it&#x2019;s funny.&#x201d;<br>It took Stian ten minutes to drive the winding road up to Tryvann Tower. The TV mast was a 118-metre-long javelin drilled into the ground at the top of Oslo&#x2019;s north-western mountains.<br><br>He came to a halt in the snow-covered car park and noted that the only other vehicle there was a red Golf. He took his skis from the roof box, put them on and skated past the main building and up to where the main chairlift, Tryvann Ekspress, marked the top of the skiing facilities. From there he could see down to the lake and the smaller Kleiva lift with T-bars. Even though there was light from the moon it was too dark to check whether the bars were moving, but he could hear it. The hum of the machinery down below.<br><br>And as he set off, skiing in long, lazy curves, it struck him how strangely still it was up here at night. It was as if the first hour after they closed was still filled with the echoes of screams of pleasure, girls&#x2019; exaggerated whines of terror, boys&#x2019; testosterone-filled cries for attention, steel edges cutting into hard-packed snow and ice. Even when they switched off the floodlights the light seemed to hang in the air for a while. But then, gradually, it became quieter. And darker. And even quieter. Until the silence filled all the hollows in the terrain, and the darkness crept out from the forest. And it was as though Tryvann became a different place, a place which even for Stian, who knew it like the back of his hand, was so unfamiliar it might as well have been another planet. A cold, dark and uninhabited planet.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>The lack of light meant he had to ski by feeling and try to predict how the snow and the ground would roll and pitch beneath the skis. But that was his special talent, which meant he always did best when there was bad visibility, heavy snow, mist, flat light: he could feel what he couldn&#x2019;t see, he had that kind of clairvoyance some skiers just have and others&#x2014;most of them&#x2014;don&#x2019;t. He caressed the snow, moving slowly to prolong the enjoyment. Then he was down and pulled up in front of the ski-lift hut.<br><br>The door had been smashed in.<br><br>There were splinters in the snow, and the door gaped wide open. It was only then that Stian realised he was alone. That it was the middle of the night, that at this moment he was in a deserted area where a crime had just been committed. Probably only a prank, but nevertheless. He could not be entirely sure. Sure it was only a prank. Sure he was on his own.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello!&#x201d; Stian shouted above the hum of the engine and rattle of the T-bars coming and going on the buzzing wire above him. And regretted it at once. The echo returned from the mountainside with the sound of his own fear. He was afraid. Because the brain had not stopped churning at &#x201c;alone&#x201d; and &#x201c;crime,&#x201d; it had carried on. Back to the old story. It wasn&#x2019;t something he thought about during the day, but now and then when he was on the evening shift and there was hardly anyone on the slopes occasionally the story did creep out of the forest with the darkness. It had been late one night, a mild snowless December. The girl must have been drugged somewhere in the city centre and been driven up here. Handcuffs and hood. She had been transported from the car park to where the door had been smashed in and she was raped inside. Stian had heard that the fifteen-year-old girl was so small and slim that if she had been unconscious the rapist or rapists could easily have carried her from the car park. You could only hope she had been unconscious throughout. But Stian had also heard that the girl had been attached to the wall by two big nails, one under each collarbone, so that he or they could rape her standing up with minimal physical contact with the walls, floor or girl. That was why the police hadn&#x2019;t found any DNA, fingerprints or clothing fibres. But perhaps that wasn&#x2019;t true. What he knew was true was that they had found the girl in three places. At the bottom of Lake Tryvann they had found the torso and head. In the forest down from the Wyller slalom course half of her lower body. On the banks of Lake Aurtje<br>the other half. And it was because the two last parts were found so far apart and so far from where she had been raped that the police had speculated that there might have been two rapists. But that was all they had, speculation. The men&#x2014;if they were men; there was no sperm to prove it&#x2014;were never found. But the chairman and other jokers liked to tell younger club members doing their first evening shift that on still nights people said they had heard sounds from the hut. Screams. Nails being hammered into the wall.<br><br>Stian released his boots from the bindings and walked to the door. Bent his knees and tensed his calves, trying to ignore his racing pulse.<br><br>Jesus, what was he expecting to see? Blood and guts? Ghosts?<br><br>He reached inside the door, found the switch with his hand and twisted.<br><br>Stared into the lit room.<br><br>On the unpainted pine wall, hanging from a nail, was a girl. She was almost naked, only a yellow bikini covering the so-called strategic parts of her suntanned body. The month was December, and the calendar was last year&#x2019;s. One very quiet evening, a few weeks before, in fact, Stian had masturbated in front of that picture. She was sexy enough, but what had excited him most was the girls passing outside the window. Him sitting there, stiffy in hand, only a metre from them. Especially the girls who took the T-bar on their own, who with an experienced hand placed the erect pole between their thighs and squeezed them together. The T-bar lifting their buttocks. Their backs arched as the extended spring attached to the pole and the wire contracted and jerked them away from him, out of sight, along the aerial tramway.<br><br>Stian entered the cabin. There was no doubt someone had been there. The power control was broken. The plastic knob lay in two sections on the floor, leaving the metal spindle sticking up from the console. He held the cold spindle between thumb and forefinger and tried to turn it, but it just slipped between his fingers. He walked over to the little fuse cupboard in the corner. The metal door was locked, and the key that used to hang from the string on the adjacent wall was gone. Strange. He went back to the console. Tried to pull the plastic covers off the controls for the floodlights and the music so he could swap one over, but realised he would destroy them as well; they were either glued or moulded. He needed something he could tighten round the spindle, a monkey wrench or something similar. As Stian pulled out a drawer from the table in front of the window he had a premonition. The same one he had when he was skiing blind.<br>He could feel what he couldn&#x2019;t see. Someone was standing outside in the darkness watching him.<br><br>He looked up.<br><br>And into a face staring at him with large, wide-open eyes.<br><br>His own face, his own terrified eyes in the reflection in the windowpane, a double exposure.<br><br>Stian breathed out with relief. Shit, he was so easily frightened.<br><br>But then, as his heart began to beat again and he shifted his attention back to the drawer, it was as if his eye caught a movement outside, a face detaching itself from the reflection and vanishing to the right and out of sight. He looked up quickly again. There was still a reflection of himself. A double exposure as before. Or was it?<br><br>He&#x2019;d always had an overactive imagination. That was what Marius and Kjella had told him when he said thinking about the raped girl turned him on. Not her being raped and killed of course. Or rather, yes, the rape was . . . something he thought about, he had added. But mostly, that she was very nice, nice and pretty, kind of. And that she had been in the cabin, naked, with a dick in her slit, that . . . yes, that was a thought that could turn him on. Marius had said he was sick and Kjella, the bastard, had of course blabbed, and when Stian heard the story again Stian was supposed to have said he would have liked to have joined in the rape. That&#x2019;s pals for you, Stian thought, rummaging through the drawer. Lift passes, stamp, stamp pad, pens, tape, scissors, sheath knife, invoice pad, screws, nuts. Bloody hell! He went on to the next drawer. No wrench, no keys. And then he realised he could just look for the emergency stop pole they usually kept rammed in the snow outside the cabin so that anyone could stop the lift by hitting the red button on top of the pole if something happened. And something was always happening: children banging their heads on the T-bar and beginners falling off backwards as the lift jerked into action, hanging on and being dragged up onto the cable. Or idiots who wanted to show off and wrapped a knee round the bar while leaning over the side to piss into the edge of the forest as they went past.<br><br>He ransacked the cupboards. The pole should be easy enough to find, about a metre long, made of metal and shaped like a crowbar with a pointed end so that it could stick into packed snow and ice. Stian pushed aside forgotten mittens, hats and goggles. Next cupboard, firefighting equipment. A bucket and cloths. First-aid kit. A torch. But no pole.<br><br>Of course they might have forgotten it when they locked up for the night.<br>He grabbed the torch and went outside, did a circuit round the cabin.<br><br>No pole there, either. Christ, had they stolen it or what? And left the lift passes? Stian thought he heard something and turned to the forest. Shone the torch on the trees.<br><br>A bird? A squirrel? Elk did sometimes come down here, but they didn&#x2019;t make much of an effort to hide. If he could only switch off the bloody lift, he would be able to hear better.<br><br>Stian went back into the cabin and noticed that he felt more at ease inside. Picked up the two pieces of the plastic knob from the floor, tried placing them around the spindle and turning, but it was no use.<br><br>He looked at his watch. Soon be midnight. He wanted to finish the round of golf in Augusta before going to bed. Wondered whether to phone the chairman. All he had to do was give this spindle a half-turn!<br><br>His head shot up instinctively and his heart stopped beating.<br><br>It had happened so quickly he was unsure whether he had seen it or not. Whatever it was, it was not an elk. Stian keyed in the name of the chairman, but his fingers were trembling so much he made several mistakes before getting it right.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The emergency pole&#x2019;s gone. I can&#x2019;t turn the lift off.&#x201d; &#x201c;The fuse cupboard . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Locked and the key&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;<br><br>He heard the chairman cursing under his breath. Then a sigh of resignation. &#x201c;Stay there. I&#x2019;m on my way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bring a wrench or something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wrench or something,&#x201d; the chairman repeated, making no attempt to conceal his contempt.<br><br>Stian had long known the chairman&#x2019;s respect was measured in terms of your ranking in skiing championships. He put his mobile in his pocket. Stared out into the darkness. And it struck him that everyone could see him with the light on and he couldn&#x2019;t see anyone. He got up, closed what was left of the door and switched off the light. Waited. The empty T-bars coming down from the slopes above his head seemed to accelerate as they swung round the end of the lift before starting the ascent again.<br><br>Stian blinked.<br><br>Why hadn&#x2019;t he thought of that before?<br><br>He turned all the knobs on the console. And as the floodlights came on over the slope Jay-Z&#x2019;s &#x201c;Empire State of Mind&#x201d; rang out<br>from the loudspeakers and filled the valley. That&#x2019;s the way, now it was a bit more homely.<br><br>He drummed his fingers and looked at the spindle again. There was a hole at the top. He got up, grabbed the string from beside the fuse cupboard, doubled it and threaded it through the hole. Wrapped it round the spindle once and pulled carefully. This could actually work. He pulled a little harder. The string was holding. Even harder. The spindle moved. He yanked it.<br><br>The sound of the lift machinery died with a long-drawn-out groan culminating in a squeal.<br><br>&#x201c;Take that, you motherfucker!&#x201d; Stian shouted.<br><br>He leaned over the phone to ring the chairman and inform him the job was done. Remembered the chairman would hardly approve of rap being played at full blast over the speakers at night and switched it off.<br><br>Listened to the phone ringing. That was all he could hear now; suddenly it was ver y quiet. Come on, answer! A nd then there it was again. The feeling. The feeling that someone was there. Someone was watching him.<br>&lt;...</p><h2>Maybeck&#39;s Landscapes: Drawing in Nature</h2><p>Maybeck&#39;s Landscapes: Drawing in Nature [Hardcover] [Jun 30, 2005] Harris, Dianne ...</p><p></p><h2>The Trench Book</h2><p>Though it began as a military uniform, the trench coat has become a cornerstone of the twenty-first century wardrobe, a kind of chic yet classic envelope that perfectly balances form and function.

Born in Arkansas, she was teaching preschool when she began writing fiction. Known for her lighthearted, witty novels, she created the Claire Malloy Mysteries and the Arly Hanks Mysteries, both set in Arkansas.Maggody, a little Ozark town where nothing ever happens, has problems. Its first female police chief, Arly Hanks (Malice in Maggody), comes back from vacation to find the community in an uproar: practically everyone is under the influence of psychic Madame Celeste, four hippies have taken over a local store and local prostitute and moonshiner Robin Buchanon has disappeared, leaving behind five hungry children. The mayor's wife, busybody Mrs. Jim Bob Buchanon (the town has a "plethora of Buchanons") wants Arly to do something about the children, a wild and uncivilized lot, but Arly manages to foist them onto Mrs. Jim Bob while she goes hunting for the mother, whom she finds with her head blown off in the middle of a marijuana patch. As she sets out to discover who planted the weed and then booby-trapped it, the children proceed to bring Mrs. Jim Bob low while Madame Celeste has premonitions of disaster. Aided by a possible new love interest, David Allen Wainright, guidance counselor at the local high school, Arly tries to help the children, particularly the foulmouthed but oddly charming Hammet. Another death and the public humiliation of two of the town's most righteous citizens take place before peace comes to Maggody once again. Hess writes an engaging tale, although the raunchy characters impart a certain vulgarity to the text. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Expressionism</h2><p><strong>Anxious angles: The pioneers and masterworks of &#x201c;degenerate&#x201d; Expressionism</strong><br><br>German Expressionists were uneasy and angry. Emerging at the dawn of the 20th century, they railed against Christian and bourgeois values as much as rampant urban industrialization. Anti-imperialist, they were dispersed, shattered, and depleted by the horrors of the First World War, and rallied their efforts only to be <strong>officially erased by the Nazi &#x201c;Degenerate Art&#x201d; exhibition of 1937</strong>.<br><br>In this comprehensive TASCHEN collection, <strong>director of the Gerhard Richter Archive Dietmar Elger</strong> gathers the many artists and elements of this urgent, scattered, complex movement into one authoritative overview of its <strong>protagonists, principles, and essential role in 20th-century modernism</strong>. Finding a critical calm amid the frenzy of color and distortion, the book distills Expressionism&#x2019;s leading collectives, Die Br�cke and Der Blaue Reiter, as well as its regional characteristics across its Berlin and Munich hubs, and its North German, Rheinland, and Viennese variants.<br><br>Along the way, we compare and contrast themes and stylistic choices as this dispersed group of <strong>artists wrestled with their modern industrial reality</strong>. We find luminous streaks from Wassily Kandinsky, and the sickly hues of Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, the futurist facets of Franz Marc, and a partial Impressionist throwback in the gaudy dabs of Emil Nolde. We meet fat faces, tired faces, and faces like African masks. We <strong>walk into seedy bars with bloated old men, and then enter a claustrophobic yellow room occupied by an awkwardly posed nude</strong>. We are crushed in a cacophony of city sound and smoke, and then left alone with woods, a lake, and silence.<br><br>Spanning this richness and range in Expressionist output, Elger features such well-known figures as <strong>Beckmann, Kandinsky, Kirchner, Kokoschka, Nolde, Schiele</strong>, while taking care to present <strong>inadequately studied artists such as Conrad Felixm�ller, Ludwig Meidner, and Marianne von Werefkin</strong>. The result is an expansive, inclusive, dependable digest of a vivid, often violent mode of expression, and the yearning and unease behind its frenzied paintwork.</p><p>Dietmar Elger studied art history, history, and literature at the University of Hamburg. In 1984/85, he was secretary of Gerhard Richter&#x2019;s studio and between 1986 and 2006 curator for painting and sculpture at the Sprengel Museum, Hanover.

Using his expert knowledge of folklore, Dundes unearths and contracts multiple versions of nearly every major biblical event, including the creation of women, the flood, the ten commandments, the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord&#39;s Prayer, and the inscription on the Cross.</p><p>Alan Dundes is known as one of the world&#39;s leading authorities on folklore. In more than 30 books he has unveiled the meanings in the oral traditions of many cultures. He lives in Berkeley, where he is professor of anthropology and folklore at the University of California.The idea that the Bible contains elements of folklore is not new. What makes Alan Dundes's latest book so remarkable, however, is his claim that the Bible is more folklore than anything else. Even more remarkable is the fact that after reading this book,such a claim seems absolutely convincing. This is an outstanding book that belongs on the shelf of anyone concerned either with folklore or the Bible. (Michael P. Carroll, University of Western Ontario)<br><br>It has long been recognized by professional biblicists that the Bible is full of duplications and that the Bible originally circulated orally. Folklorist Alan Dundes' original contribution, carried out with the spriteliness and verve for which he is celebrated, is to show how the duplications are not contingent but inherent in the nature of folklore, and thereby to show how the folkloristic nature of the Bible continues in even its written form.

In pieces that appeared in <i>The New Yorker </i>and were anthologized in <i>Best American Essays</i>, Antrim explored<br>his intense and complicated relationships with his mother, Louanne, an artist and teacher who was, at her worst, a ferociously destabilized and destabilizing alcoholic; his gentle grandfather, who lived in the mountains of North Carolina and who always hoped to save his daughter from herself; and his father, who married Louanne twice. <br><i>The Afterlife </i>is not a temporally linear coming-of-age memoir; instead, Antrim follows a logic of unconscious life, of dreams and memories, of fantasies and psychoses, the way in which the world of the alcoholic becomes a sleepless, atemporal world. In it, he comes to terms with&#x2014;and fails to comes to terms with&#x2014;the nature of addiction and the broken states of loneliness, shame, and loss that remain beyond his power to fully repair. This is a tender and even blackly hilarious portrait of a family&#x2014;faulty, cracked, enraging. It is also the story of the way the author works, in part through writing this book, to become a man more fully alive to himself and to others, a man capable of a life in which he may never learn, or ever hope to know, the nature of his origins.</p><p><b>DONALD ANTRIM</b> is the author of <i>Elect Mr. Robinson for a Better World</i>, <i>The Hundred Brothers</i>, and <i>The Verificationist</i>.

She was lying in new purple sheets on a hospital-style bed rolled up next to the green oxygen tanks set against a wall in what was more or less the living room of her oddly decorated, dark and claustrophobic house, down near the bottom of a drive that wound like a rut past a muddy construction site and backyards bordered with chain-link fence, coming to an end in the parking lot that served the cheerless duck pond at the center of the town in which she had lived the last five years of her life, Black Mountain, North Carolina. The occasion for my mother&#x2019;s move to North Carolina from Florida had been the death of her father, Don Self, from a heart attack, in 1995. Don Self&#x2019;s widow, my mother&#x2019;s mother, Roxanne, was at that time beginning her fall into senility, and was, in any case, unequipped to manage the small estate that my grandfather had left in her name. What I mean to say is that my grandmother, who came of age in the Great Depression and who brought away from that era almost no concept of money beyond the idea that it is not good to give too much of it to one&#x2019;s children, was unlikely to continue her husband&#x2019;s tradition of making large monthly transfers into my mother&#x2019;s bank account. Don Self had kept his daughter afloat for a long while&#x2014;ever since she&#x2019;d got sober, thirteen years before, and decided that she was an artist and a visionary, ahead of her time&#x2014;and now, suddenly, it was incumbent on my mother to seize power of attorney over her mother and take control of the portfolio, a coup she might have accomplished from Miami but was better able to arrange through what in the espionage community is known as closework.<br>&nbsp;<br>Four years later, Roxanne Self passed away. The funeral was held at the Black Mountain Presbyterian Church in September of 1999.

There had never been any talking to her about her smoking. The news that she had cancer came as no surprise. It had grown in her bronchi and was inoperable. Radiation was held out as a palliative&#x2014;it might (and briefly did) shrink the tumor enough to allow air into the congested lung&#x2014;but my mother was not considered a candidate for chemotherapy. She had, during the course of forty years of, as they say, hard living, progressively and inexorably deteriorated. The story of my mother&#x2019;s lifelong deterioration is, in some respects, the story of her life. The story of my life is bound up in this story, the story of her deterioration. It is the story that is always central to the ways in which I perceive myself and others in the world. It is the story, or at any rate it is my role in the story, that allows me never to lose my mother.</p><h2>Finding Peace: God&#39;s Promise of a Life Free from Regret, Anxiety, And Fear (Walker Large Print Books)</h2><p><p>In times of crisis and confusion, Dr. Charles Stanley has learned the one phrase that can carry him through: "God, You are in control." The peace he has experienced in life stems from that foundational belief. In <i>Finding Peace</i>, Dr. Stanley shares with readers how they, too, can experience an unshakeable peace which "passes all understanding." </p> <p>Filled with encouragement to lift the soul, <i>Finding Peace</i> offers insight on what causes us to live without God's peace in our lives, and how we can reverse course and open our hearts to receive it. Also, Stanley gives his perspective on the things that hinder peace-including the "Four Great Hallmarks of God's Peace" and "Five Essential Beliefs for a Peaceful Heart"-to put the important message of this book into concrete terms. Addressing regret, anxiety, and fear, Dr. Stanley extends hope for overcoming the obstacles that block peace with the Lord. Finally, he gives direction on learning to live a life of contentment.</p></p><p>Dr. Charles Stanley is the senior pastor of the First Baptist Church of Atlanta, where he has served for more than 40 years.

Before they became part of the national bloodstream, they created an underground swell, encouraging adventurous listeners to jack into their matrix of pantonality, feedback, and chiming scree. All the while, Lee Ranaldo was drinking in the landscape, the clubs, the people; recording a journal of this wild ride.</p><p>Ranaldo (Road Movies) is the guitarist for Sonic Youth, arguably the most vital and enduring band to have emerged from American punk rock. They cut through the vapidity of '80s Top 40 and enabled the angry rise of Nirvana and company to megastardom, and still, after two decades together, make music that is innovative and influential. Ranaldo's writings from the decade that made the band a legend are collected here. However, both the fan looking for a comprehensive tour diary and the rock historian searching for insights will be disappointed. This thin volume is too crowded and the writing is too variedAstream of consciousness prose, performance poetry, song lyrics, letters to friends and family. It is as dense with noise and as far-flung as a Sonic Youth tour circa 1985. The long prose pieces tend to be the best of the lot, the most enjoyable of these from the Australian tour in 1989. Some observations hit home: of London, Ranaldo observes that "the same old rock scene stuff is going down here as anywhere, only the haircuts have been changed to protect the innocent." But too much falls flat. In particular, the poetry (hard to distinguish from the song lyrics that are also reproduced here) simply shows how much better it would be to listen to Sonic Youth's albums than read this.

Gibbes eventually returns to Great Britain, there dedicating his life as an Orthodox priest to the memory of the Imperial Family and the faith he discovered in their distant homeland.</p><p>Out of the dampness of a Lond morning steps an elderly, white-bearded man in a threadbard cassock. He carries a walking stick in his right hand, and a tattered black shopping bag on his left arm. His name is Father Nicholas Gibbes. <p>Warm and affable, yet intensely private, he seldom speakes of the incredible journey which carried him from the hallowed halls of St. John's College in Cambridge to the court of the last Russian Tsar, Nicholas II. As one of three tutors to the Imperial Family, he had gained entrance to the inner world of the ill-fated Family. First as teach, but soon as trusted friend and confidant, he walked with them through the dark days of their exile and eventual murder at the hands of the Bosheviks. These ten years would change the course of his life, eventually leading him back to Great Britain, where he would devote himself the rest of his days in service to the Faith he had discovered in the midst of the court of the Tsar. </p><p>Centering her research around actual letters and documents from the Gibbes collections in England and numerous personal interviews with the late George Gibbes, adopted son of Father Nicholas, as well as other surviving acquaintances and friends, the author has carefully documented this fascinating story as Gibbes journeys from Great Britain to Russia, Siberia, China, the Philippines, Jerusalem, and finally back again to England. Benaugh's account profits from newly uncovered evidence regarding the murders of the Imperial Family and offers details which were unknown during the lifetime of Fr. Nicholas. She carefully documents hitherto unpublished events of his life in England as an Orthodox priest and his foundational role in establishing the Orthodox Church in Oxford as well as his pioneering role in the development of British Orthodoxy.</p>Christine Benagh makes her home in Nashville, TN. After earning her degree from Vanderbilt University, she began serious writing while overseeing the household for her husband and four lively children. As their demands on her time and attention diminished, she took up a career in editing and continued writing, publishing two books, several journal articles, and numerous reviews.</p><h2>Big Cherry Holler</h2><p>BIG CHERRY HOLLER, the extraordinary sequel to BIG STONE GAP, takes us back to the mountain life that enchanted us in Adriana Trigiani&#x2019;s best selling debut novel.

Medea is profoundly sympathetic even as the seeds are sown for the monstrous life ahead of her, and the brute strength of Hercules leaves him no less vulnerable to the vicissitudes of love.

But it seems that in our desire to get to those adventures and doctrines, we all too often skip vital portions of the Book of Mormon - the writings of Isaiah. In Unlocking Isaiah in the Book of Mormon, Dr. Victor L. Ludlow reminds us why it is crucial that we study the writings of Isaiah, and not simply plow through or skip over them in our scripture reading. The words of Isaiah are scattered throughout the Book of Mormon like rare gems of great value and worth. And though we may sometimes feel that Isaiah&#39;s meaning and intent are locked away in a treasure chest, Dr. Ludlow has taken the time to unlock the meaning of his prophetic wisdom and symbolic poetry until they are clear and unmistakable.</p><p></p><h2>Recollections of a Happy Life, Vol. 1 of 2: Being the Autobiography of Marianne North (Classic Reprint)</h2><p>A lderley.

Sexual and social roles still determined the extent to which a woman could pursue education and intellectual accomplishment, but it was possible through the composition of poetry or prose to temporarily offset hierarchies of gender, to become equal to men in the act of creation.</p><p>Edited by Katharina M. Wilson, this anthology introduces the works of twenty-five women writers of the Renaissance and Reformation, among them Marie Denti�re, a Swiss evangelical reformer whose writings were so successful they were banned during her lifetime; Gaspara Stampa, a cultivated courtesan of Venetian aristocratic circles who wrote lyric poetry that has earned her comparisons to Michelangelo and Tasso; H�lisenne de Crenne, a French aristocrat who embodied the true spirit of the Renaissance feminist, writing both as novelist and as champion of her sex; Helene Kottanner, Austrian chambermaid to Queen Elizabeth of Hungary whose memoirs recall her daring theft of the Holy Crown of Saint Stephen for her esteemed mistress; and Lady Mary Sidney Wroth, the first Englishwoman known to write a full-length work of fiction and compose a significant body of secular poetry.</p><p>Offering a seldom seen counterpoint to literature written by men, <i>Women Writers of the Renaissance and Reformation</i> presents prose and poetry that have never before appeared in English, as well as writings that have rarely been available to the nonspecialist. The women whose writings are included here are united by a keen awareness of the social limitations placed upon their creative potential, of the strained relationship between their gender and their work. This concern invests their writings with a distinctive voice&#x2015;one that carries the echoes of a male aesthetic while boldly declaring battle against it.</p></p><p>KATHARINA M. WILSON is a professor of comparative literature at the University of Georgia. She is the author of several books and the editor of <i>Medieval Women Writers</i> (Georgia).This successor to the editor's Medieval Women Writers (Georgia, 1984) gathers and introduces the work of many writers, some virtually unknown. Explanatory essays offer balanced accounts of the significance of each; bibliographies encourage further study. All kinds of writing, from poetry to spiritual writing to political speeches, are represented. The book's coverage of a narrow time span is almost too thorough, making it more a reference volume than an anthology. Its contribution is to bring together material not otherwise readily available for continued research on women, especially as writers. Margaret Hallissy, English Dept., Long Island Univ., C.W.

For the young Native American girl in Paul Goble's 1979 Caldecott-winning masterpiece, <i>The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses</i>, it is a blessing. Although she loves her people, this girl has a much deeper, almost sacred connection to her equine friends. The storm gives her the opportunity to fulfill her dream--to live in a beautiful land among the wild horses she loves.<p> With brilliant, stylized illustrations and simple text, Paul Goble tells the story of a young woman who follows her heart, and the family that respects and accepts her uniqueness. Considering how difficult it is for some communities to allow friendships to grow between people of different cultures, this village's support for the girl's companions of choice is admirable. Goble's bold paintings reflect this noble open-mindedness. The young horse fanatic of the house will joyfully add this book to his or her collection. Children are passionate people; they will relate. (All ages) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>In Paul Goble's Caldecott-winning story, tending to the horses is the special pleasure of one young girl in the village. Her skills are unsurpassed, and people take notice. When a violent thunderstorm crazes the herd, both it and the girl travel to new destinations. As narrator, Lance White Magpie sets an expectant tone, as it appears that the horses will change the girl's life. Finally, his voice becomes one of confidence and satisfaction when the young girl finds her place beside the spotted stallion. Gentle music surrounds the story. Chants and songs from Sioux and Navaho traditions complete the recording.

Perverse and grotesque comedy alternates with scenes of 'oriental' magnificence and evocative beauty in the story of the ruthless Caliph Vathek's journey to superb damnation among the subterranean treasures of Eblis. Underlying the elegant prose is a strong element of self-indulgent personal fantasy on the part of Beckford, youthful millionaire, dreamer, and eventually social outcast. Byron, Poe, Mallarm�, and Swinburne are some of the literary figures who have admired Vathek's imaginative power. The text follows that of the 'Third Edition' of 1816, in which Beckford extensively revised and corrected Samuel Henley's original English translations from the French.

It's a secret!</p> <p>That line had run around in Jasmine's mind all day on a continuous loop. She imagined two little girls playing out on the grassy lawn with their Barbie dolls, and it was a secret where Barbie and Ken were going for supper. Then two middle school girls in her bedroom gossiping about boys, and it was a secret.</p> <p>Oh, the secrets she and Pearl had shared through the years, and now she had one that she couldn't share with anyone, not even Pearl.</p> <p>"No one in Texas is ever going to know. Not even Pearl. I'll go home and everything will be the same. I'll wake up Monday morning, open the Chicken Fried Caf�, and business will go on as usual and by then I'll forget all about this wedding. It'll be a secret, alright, but between me and Ace, and no one else will ever know." She talked to herself as she flopped her suitcase on the hotel bed and unzipped it. Her hands were shaking. A fine bead of moisture covered her upper lip, and second thoughts were about to smother her plumb to death.</p> <p>She and Ace had taken different flights. He'd flown out of Dallas on Friday and gotten their rooms. She'd arrived late Saturday afternoon and caught a taxi to the hotel. It was down to the wire, swim or drown time, red light or green light. Her hands were clammy and sweat was pooling up around the band of her bra. Nervously, she looked at the clock. The hands whipped around so fast that it made her dizzy. Where had the time gone?</p> <p>She took a quick shower, washed and dried her long, dark hair, and applied makeup. Then it was time to dress. Thank God the plane had been on time or she would have been rushed. She couldn't have stood a dose of nervous and one of hurry-up at the same time.</p> <p>The white satin dress fit tightly to the waist with a hem that stopped right above her knee. Filmy illusion was attached to a white Stetson hat in a big bow with the streamers hanging to her waist. It was sprinkled with pearls and edged with lace. The shoes were white satin with beadwork on the high heels. But Jasmine didn't feel like a bride. She felt like an imposter.</p> <p>A rapid rat-a-tat-tat on the door said the time was up. She opened the door to find Ace smiling from ear to ear and holding a black Stetson. He was damn sexy in his black Western-cut jacket, creased black Wranglers, and white shirt unbuttoned at the collar. His blond curls were almost tamed with a healthy dose of gel, but a few still escaped to float playfully on his forehead. But then it was common knowledge that Ace Riley was a player, so he would know exactly how to dress, how to swagger, how to use that Texas drawl, and how to smile to attract the women.</p> <p>He braced an arm against the doorjamb and let his gray-blue eyes slowly scan her from high heels to Stetson. That didn't surprise Jasmine either. Flirting came as natural to Ace as breathing. The first thing he did when he walked into the caf� was scope it out for new skirt tails; the second was turn on the charm.</p> <p>"Whew! You clean up pretty damn good, Jazzy." His sexy Texas drawl was deep, and his words came out slow. Most women melted when he walked through the door and swooned when he opened his mouth. He'd never affected Jasmine that way, not until that moment.</p> <p>She'd seen him before in dress jeans and crisply ironed shirts but never as fancy as he was that day. Most of the time he came into the caf� in his scuffed work boots, faded jeans, and shirts with the sleeves cut out; the barbed wire tat around his arm was a constant reminder that he never intended to let a woman anywhere near his heart. A motel bed or her bed, yes, but never his heart or his bedroom.</p> <p>"Those are two places I'm saving for the love of my life if I ever meet her," he'd told Jasmine once while he was eating hamburgers in her kitchen.</p> <p>Jasmine struck a pose for him. "Do I look like a blushing bride? You know you shouldn't be seeing me before the wedding. It's bad luck."</p> <p>He fanned his face with his black Stetson and whistled through his teeth. "Oh, darlin', you look every bit the part, and don't worry about bad luck. We're in Vegas and no one knows what we're up to. You know what they say: What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas! We ain't got a thing to worry about. Shall we go get married?"</p> <p>She looped her arm into his and pulled the door shut.</p> <p>The elevator was right across from her room and opened immediately when he pushed the down button. "See, it's an omen. Nothing bad is going to happen because I saw you in that cute little dress. Besides, the rules are different in Vegas."</p> <p>"Oh yeah?" She looked up at him.</p> <p>"Sure they are. Didn't you read the rule book in the drawer right beside the Gideon Bible? God, Jazzy, this ain't your first time in Vegas, is it?"</p> <p>"Hell, no! I've been here before and you are full of shit! There is no rule book in the drawer." She giggled.</p> <p>"Did you look? Tell me, did you look in the drawer since you've been here this time?"</p> <p>"Yes, I did," she lied.</p> <p>"Well, shit! Someone stole your rule book. Well, on page five, paragraph six, it says that the groom can see the bride on the wedding day and that it will bring them good luck. Paragraph seven says that the only thing they have to be careful with is the blackjack tables. If the bride is wearing her wedding dress, they will lose their money there. So all we have to do is stay away from the blackjack tables. Besides, what bride and groom would spend their time gambling anyway? They'd be rufflin' up the sheets with some hot-as-hell sex," Ace said.</p> <p>"You are full of bullshit, Ace," she laughed.</p> <p>The elevator doors slid open and he strutted out with her on his arm. Heads turned as they walked past the blackjack tables, the roulette wheels, and the slot machines. Jasmine saw one woman fan herself with the back of her hand, another licked her lips as if she could taste his kisses, and at least two wiggled as if they needed to make a dash to the bathroom and change their underpants.</p> <p>Ace noticed men with hungry eyes ogling Jazzy as if they'd like to lay her down on satin sheets and peel that tight-fittin' dress off her slow and easy. Truth was that he was thinking about how those full lips would taste; if that long hair would feel like silk as he tangled it up in his fingers; or how slick those legs would be wrapped around him in a Jacuzzi. He shook his head to knock out the vision and another kinky blond curl fell down on his forehead. He didn't bother pushing it back. After the wedding he would settle his black Stetson on his head and that would keep the pesky curls away from his eyes.</p> <p>At the curb, he raised his hand and a taxi pulled right up. "See, more good luck. Elevator right there waiting for us and now a taxi is Johnny-on-the-spot. I tell you this is our night, Miz Jazzy."</p> <p>"Okay, I believe you, Ace. Nothing can go wrong, and what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Shhh, it's a secret." She held one finger to her lips.</p> <p>He opened the door and held the streamers from her hat while Jasmine crawled into the backseat and then he followed her.</p> <p>"Yes, it is a secret. Our secret and we'll leave it right here, so don't worry, darlin'," he whispered.</p> <p>His warm breath started something boiling down deep in her stomach. But that shouldn't come as a surprise. She had dated four men in the past year and a half. One of them got past the second date. None of them got further than a good-night kiss.</p> <p>"Cupid's Wedding Chapel," he told the driver.</p> <p>"I'll have you there in twenty minutes. Traffic is pretty bad this time of night," he said.</p> <p>"We need to be there at seven." Ace checked his watch. They had fifteen minutes. Dammit! He'd forgotten to figure in traffic. He'd just figured on getting there right at the time, doing the deed, and getting back to the hotel where he would play the slots for a couple of hours and go to bed.</p> <p>"Then we'll take a short cut. Hang on to your hats."</p> <p>"What happens at the chapel?" Jazzy asked.</p> <p>"I bought a package deal. Pictures. Bouquet for you. License in a cute little folder with a seal on the front and the ceremony. The lawyer said to bring him a valid marriage license, but I'm taking pictures so Cole can see it was a real wedding. I appreciate you getting all dressed up, Jazzy," he said softly.</p> <p>She punched his arm playfully. "What are friends for?"</p> <p>He grinned. "God knows I don't want you to back out, but I wouldn't blame you, and we'd still be friends if you are about to change your mind."</p> <p>She shook her head emphatically. "Hell, no! That sumbitch Cole isn't getting the farm. But I do have one question, Ace. How is it that he won't be tellin' the whole family anyway?"</p> <p>Ace graced her with his brightest smile. "Ranch, darlin'. Not farm."</p> <p>"Okay, let's put it this way: That sumbitch Cole ain't gettin' your Texas dirt whether you grow potatoes or Angus calves," she said.</p> <p>He chuckled. "I like the part about sumbitch Cole, and I'll stick to Angus. And I'll explain the Cole situation to you after the wedding. Don't worry. He won't tell a soul about the ranch if he doesn't get it."</p> <p>The taxi pulled up in front of a sweet little white chapel and parked behind a long, white limo with a driver standing at attention beside it. Ace gave the driver a bill. Jasmine scooted out of the taxi. She hadn't planned on moving so much in the tight-fitting dress when she bought it the previous spring. It was supposed to be worn to a personal shower for a friend, but they'd changed their minds, decided to have the shower at a honky tonk, and everyone wore jeans. It had hung in her closet until that morning when she went looking for something to wear to her wedding.</p> <p>Ace tucked her arm into his again. "Love the hat thing," he said.</p> <p>"Spur of the moment. Pearl was going to use it for her wedding and Tess pitched a fit, so she told me to do something with it. It's my something borrowed," she said.</p> <p>"What's blue?"</p> <p>She hooked a finger under her skirt tail, raised it a notch, and showed him a blue garter.</p> <p>"Old?"</p> <p>"Bra and underpants." She giggled.</p> <p>"New? The dress?" Ace asked.</p> <p>"Yes, it is. Never worn, so it's still new," she said.</p> <p>"Then we've got it covered." He slung an arm around her shoulder. It wasn't the first time Ace had hugged her or even walked across the caf� floor with his arm around her, so why did steamy little hot tingles dance up and down her spine?</p> <p>The door opened at the exact time they stepped through the archway onto the porch, and a smiling woman motioned them inside. "You'd be Ace and Jasmine. You are right on time. I'm Harriett and I'll be acting as your wedding planner tonight. My, don't you both look beautiful."</p> <p>Ace cleared his throat.</p> <p>Harriett laughed. "Handsome, then. Does that work better for you, cowboy?"</p> <p>"Yes, ma'am, it surely does."</p> <p>She picked up a nosegay of red roses with streaming satin ribbons that matched the roses perfectly. "Hold them at waist level and loop your arm though his. It makes for prettier pictures and gives me time to get to the front of the chapel before you start down the aisle so I can get good pictures of you."</p> <p>Jasmine nodded. Harriett didn't look a thing like Marcella, her mother's cousin and most sought-after wedding planner in Sherman, Texas, but the authority in her voice sure reminded Jasmine of Marcella.</p> <p>The lady hurried across the small foyer to swing open double doors into a tiny chapel with twenty white folding chairs on each side of the short center aisle. The traditional wedding march started playing softly from speakers attached to the pulpit at the front the moment the doors opened.</p> <p>Jasmine wondered if they were on a timer&#x2015;kind of like a clock wired up to a bomb. If so, what detonated the bomb? The words "I do"?</p> <p>The preacher motioned them forward. Harriet rushed down the aisle in front of them, turned around, and started snapping pictures. Cole wouldn't have a leg to stand on if he contested the marriage with all the pictures the woman took between the back of the chapel and the pulpit.</p> <p>Jasmine was amazed to see that the chapel was completely full of people but figured they must be waiting for the next wedding, the one with the bride and groom waiting in the white limo out front. She wondered if they were movie stars or celebrities who had snuck off from Hollywood for a quickie marriage, and if the people in the audience were paparazzi from every ragtag gossip paper in the whole country.</p> <p>They barely made it to the front when the preacher intoned in a loud voice, "We are gathered here this day to unite"&#x2015;he looked down at the marriage license on the pulpit&#x2015;"Jasmine King and Ace Riley in holy matrimony... Hand your flowers to Harriett," he whispered.</p> <p>Jasmine looked around to find Harriett reaching for the flowers. She laid the bouquet on an empty chair and went back to taking pictures.</p> <p>"They'll send them to my computer via email. Be there when we get home. I wasn't expecting so many, though," Ace whispered.</p> <p>The preacher went on, "Now, Ace, take her hands in yours and face each other."</p> <p>When they were facing each other the preacher smiled and a flash went off behind Jasmine. These people really took the business of quickie marriages seriously.</p> <p>"In this time-honored tradition of a wedding ceremony, Jasmine and Ace have come before me to repeat their vows to each other and to exchange rings. If there is anyone who has a reason they shouldn't be married, please step forward now and state your cause or forever hold your peace."</p> <p>He paused for a minute, wiped his sweaty face with a white handkerchief pulled from behind the oak pulpit, and used both hands to slick back his thick black hair. The smile never left his face, and Jasmine heard several clicks behind her. Surely, those crazy people didn't think she and Ace were the celebrities. Granted, she'd been asked before if she was kin to Dr. Cuddy on House. Maybe she should stop the wedding and tell them that the real celebrities were hiding in the limo outside, and they were wasting their batteries on a cowboy and a caf� owner from Ringgold, Texas, population less than a hundred.</p> <p>"No one to protest?" the preacher asked again.</p> <p>Jasmine bit back a giggle. Her four best friends, Liz, Pearl, Austin, and Gemma, would be stampeding through the chapel like a herd of longhorn heifers if they had any inkling what was going on that minute. But they didn't and wouldn't ever. Maybe someday when they were all sharing a room in a nursing home she'd tell them about the year she was married to Ace Riley. The vision that popped into her head was five old ladies sitting around a domino table. Pearl was the one with lightly frosted, red kinky hair, shooting daggers at the old man winking at them; Austin and Gemma would have gray streaks in their dark hair, but Liz, gypsy that she was, wouldn't have changed all that much.</p> <p>"Yes, well, apparently no one wants to object, so we will continue," the preacher said. His smile was plastered on as if he expected it to get him through the pearly gates of heaven that very night, and the cameras all over the chapel kept up a steady clicking noise.</p> <p>Jasmine was giddy with nerves over repeating v...</p></p><h2>Ebony Rising: Short Fiction of the Greater Harlem Renaissance Era</h2><p><p>Ebony Rising is the first comprehensive, gender-balanced collection of short fiction from the greater Harlem Renaissance era (1912&#x2013;1940). This was a time marked by writing of extraordinary breadth and depth by some of the most famous authors in African American literary history. Among them were Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Jean Toomer, Dorothy West, and Claude McKay. Not surprisingly, these authors have received an unprecedented amount of critical attention, and their work remains popular to this day. </p><p>For this anthology, Craig Gable has selected 52 short stories by 37 writers (20 women and 17 men) representing a wide range of style, form, subject matter, and social awareness. To underscore the movement&#x2019;s growth and change, the stories are arranged chronologically by year of publication. Some will be familiar to readers; many more will not, for this is not the "greatest hits" of the Harlem Renaissance. Instead, readers will find a remarkable collection of fiction by authors famous and obscure&#x2015;some who lived in New York City and others who never resided there. There are stories set in Harlem, but they are just as likely to take place elsewhere in the United States. Alongside traditional stories, there are examples of detective fiction, political satire, even science fiction, with a few experiments in narrative structure and form for good measure. The stories take up issues of race, marriage, parenthood, crime, politics, religion, work, abuse, old age, and death&#x2015;in short, the stuff of life, and of compelling and lasting fiction.</p><p>A selected bibliography documents some 300 books and articles on the Harlem Renaissance. There is a separate list of sources for other short stories by the authors appearing in this anthology; a list of award-winning short fiction from two black literary contests of the day; timelines of important historical, literary, and cultural events; and other aids for teachers, students, and reading groups.</p></p><p>2005 AAUP Public and Secondary School Library Selection<p>Craig Gable is an independent scholar and professional librarian.

It is the most ambitious history of the continent ever undertaken.</p><p>With <i>Europe: A History</i>, University of London professor Norman Davies has undertaken the near impossible: a synthetic one-volume overview of Europe from prehistory through the present. Remarkably, he has succeeded. <i>Europe: A History</i> is a conventional narrative, proceeding forward in time at a gradually decelerating pace. (The beginning covers millions of years of prehistory, while the final chapter discusses the 46 years between World War II and the book's publication.) But Davies's writing--vigorous, incisive, and confidently knowledgeable--carries the reader along, while the steady sweep of the main narrative is broken up by "capsules," boxed passages examining particular places, customs, or issues that cut across chronological lines. Davies, who has written two books on Polish history, also gives the eastern part of Europe its due coverage, unlike many of his predecessors, and manages to include commoners and the persecuted or ignored in his story along with the mighty and the royal. <i>Europe: A History</i> won't please everybody, but it's a highly intelligent, superbly readable overview that is certain to become a standard text.NORMAN DAVIES C.M.G., F.B.A. is Professor Emeritus of the University of London, a Supernumerary Fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford, and the author of several books on Polish and European history, including <i>God's Playground, White Eagle, Red Star, The Isles, Microcosm</i> and <i>Europe: East and West</i>.</p><h2>Learning for the eternities</h2><p>&#34;We live in a society in which every righteous principle is being challenged, if not recklessly abandoned, and in which every degrading, immoral, and soul-destroying impulse is being wantonly gratified. Unless we can be persuaded to learn about and for the eternities, we shall not only be unprepared for eternity, but we shall also bring destruction upon ourselves here and now.&#34; This statement provides the theme for this inspirational book by President Marion G. Romney, second counselor in the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. With great wisdom and insight into eternal truths, he outlines the basic principles every Latter-day Saint needs to learn to gain the highest exaltation in the eternities. Learning for the Eternities has five parts. The first, &#34;The Character of Deity,&#34; deals with the nature of the Godhead, man as a child of God, the purpose of the Atonement, and how men are saved. Part 2, &#34;Learning for the Eternities,&#34; focuses on learning gospel principles through study, faith, and example. Part 3, &#34;Seek to Know the Father&#39;s Will and Obey Him,&#34; tells how to apply gospel principles in one&#39;s life. Part 4, &#34;The Way to Peace,&#34; outlines how one can find inner strength and security, while Part 5 is on &#34;Strength of Character.&#34; Learning for the Eternities provides a way of life based on the teachings of the prophets through the ages, the scriptures, and the commandments of God, as interpreted by a modern-day prophet and spiritual leader.</p><p></p><h2>Mysteries</h2><p>Through personal experience, Colin Wilson discovered that human beings consist of a ladder or hierarchy of selves, whose upper members may be called upon at will for personal transformation and deep knowledge.

Persistence and common sense help, but the chief ingredient is getting the right information and using it correctly. The audacious claim in Steinberg's subtitle is based on his own successes using his "key elements," some of which are rapid earnings growth, insider buying, and price momentum. The longest and most helpful chapter walks the reader through the numbers of IBM's 1995 annual report, analyzing the income statement, the balance sheet, and the cash-flow statement. In concert with many other similar works, Steinberg's book assumes (probably wrongly) that the average investor will be phoning company officials for clarification and information. Some of his "key element" information is most readily available in his own newsletter, which he touts often, but his book should help even experienced investors become better stock pickers.?Alexander Wenner, Indiana Univ.

As she settles in, she surveys every inch of the natural world within a 30-foot radius of her home, from the families of bats and deer to the varying wildlife patterns.</p><p>Northwest writer and illustrator Stewart takes readers on a guided tour as she buys land and builds her dream home on a remote island off the Washington coast. The writing is often merely serviceable, and much in the vein of a private diary, but it's redeemed by her knowledge of the area and about the world around her. There are many details about the numerous locals who become friends and help along the way: the builder; the architect; the dowser who tells her where to dig the well ("Ted says he has had the ability to dowse for around fifty years, but it was only nine years ago that he 'put out a shingle' "); the identifier of moss; the friend who brings feathers to toss in the air that are caught by swallows building their own nests. As she settles in, Stewart surveys every inch of the natural world within a 30-foot radius of her home, from the families of bats and deer to the varying patterns of wildlife from season to season. She also serves as an informal guide to the island as she learns the ways and patterns of local life, punctuated by the ferry schedule. An intensely personal story, Stewart's experience will ring true to those intimately familiar with this part of the world and gives a window in for all who are not. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Islands hold a fascination for many people.

In their bizarre way, these were carefully controlled wars, carefully controlled in the sense that neither great power allowed itself to become directly engaged in a hot war with the other. Equally, neither allowed itself to go for broke in a grand sweep across the Third World in fear of provoking that final confrontation. But this fear of direct confrontation was never as rigidly controlled as one would think. Again and again events veered towards a clash between Eagle and Bear. The authors of this book make real such terrifying possibilities as Korea or the 67 War dragging in both superpowers; they predict the consequences of the United States or the Soviet Union attempting radical strategies in Vietnam or in a divided Germany, either to follow the British success in Malaya or to invade the North; they imagine the invasion of Cuba when the delicate signals failed to find a way out of the Missile Crisis and bring to life a scenario in which the Soviet Union knocks the Great Game off the board by using Afghanistan as base to bring down Pakistan and achieve its warm water port on the Indian Ocean. Cold War Hot vividly brings to life these and many other alternate scenarios, taking the reader behind the scenes at these momentous moments in history. In showing what could have happened, the authors show how precarious the Cold War peace actually was, and how little it would have taken to tip the balance into World War Three.</p><p>Peter G.

Two years ago, Riley Young fled from Lawton, Alabama. After accusing the oldest Lawton son, Rhett, of rape, she was called a liar by everyone, and she had no option but to leave. Now she&#39;s back, but she&#39;s not at Lawton High finishing up her senior year. She&#39;s at home raising the little girl who no one believed was Rhett&#39;s. Rhett is off at college living the life he was afraid he&#39;d lose with Riley&#39;s accusation, so Riley agrees to move back to Lawton so that she and her parents can care for her grandmother, who is suffering from Alzheimer&#39;s. But the town hasn&#39;t forgotten their hate for her, and she hasn&#39;t forgotten the way they turned on her when she needed them most. When town golden boy Brady Higgens finds Riley and her daughter, Bryony, stranded on the side of the road in a storm, he pulls over and gives them a ride - not because he cares about Riley, of course, but because of the kid. But after that simple car ride, he begins to question everything he thought he knew.

Something was burning and Bryony wasn&#x2019;t in bed beside me. Her sweet blond curls and big blue eyes were what normally met me when I opened my eyes.<br> <br>Jumping up, I ran through the already open door of my bedroom and sprinted toward the kitchen. A million things ran through my mind as I went the short distance. Bryony never got out of bed without me. Another crash happened just as I turned the corner into the kitchen.<br> <br>My grandmamma was standing at the sink with a frantic look on her face. The pot on the floor had been full of uncooked oats and milk, which were now splattered on the tile floor. Smoke was coming from the toaster behind her, and I moved quickly to jerk the plug out of the wall before things got worse.<br> <br>&#x201c;Momma,&#x201d; Bryony&#x2019;s sweet voice called out from behind me.<br> <br>Spinning around, needing to see her face and know she was okay, I almost slipped on the milk under my feet.<br> <br>The wild curls of her hair were sticking up everywhere as she stared up at me with wide eyes and a frown. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m some hungwy,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>I reached down to pick her up before she stepped into the mess on the floor and cradled her against me. Holding her was enough reassurance to calm me down.<br> <br>&#x201c;Grandmamma was trying to fix you something, I see,&#x201d; I said, looking toward my grandmother, who was now looking down at the spilled breakfast at her feet.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Grandmamma said. Her voice sounded lost, like she wasn&#x2019;t sure what she was saying or why she was standing there. This was normal for her. Some days were better. Others were not. Today was not going to be a good day.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put Bryony in her high chair and get her some cereal, and then I&#x2019;ll clean this up. What do you want me to fix you, Grandmamma?&#x201d; I asked her.<br> <br>She turned her gaze to mine, and the confusion there always made me sad. The woman who had taught me to make biscuits and sang me songs while playing the pots and pans like drums was no longer there. She was lost inside her head.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; she said, which were words I heard often.<br> <br>I moved over to put Bryony in her high chair before going to take my grandmamma&#x2019;s arm and move her away from the slippery mess. Most mornings I woke up earlier than my grandmother. Today I had overslept. My mom normally woke me up before she left for work, but today she either had tried and failed or had forgotten.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m some hungwy,&#x201d; Bryony said again. That was her way of telling me she wanted food, and now. If she&#x2019;d woken up and found Grandmamma in the kitchen, she would have told her the same thing. For a moment, Grandmamma had known that meant she needed to feed her. But that brief memory left and she had dropped a pot. A dish was also broken on the floor with what looked like applesauce on it. Then, of course, the burned toast.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I told her and reached for a box of cereal to place some on her tray. &#x201c;Eat this and let Mommy clean up the mess.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bryony picked up a piece of the round oat cereal and put it in her mouth.<br> <br>&#x201c;I broke a plate.&#x201d; Grandmamma&#x2019;s voice was full of concern.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay. Accidents happen. I&#x2019;m going to clean this up, then I&#x2019;ll make you some of your favorite steel-cut oats with brown sugar and apple slices. Okay?&#x201d; I assured her with a smile.<br> <br>She frowned. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my favorite?&#x201d;<br> <br>It was like dealing with another child. We hadn&#x2019;t been back in Lawton, Alabama, long, but the time we had been back hadn&#x2019;t been easy. Watching someone you love so much live lost in their own head was heartbreaking. Alzheimer&#x2019;s was a terrible disease.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gandma hungwry,&#x201d; Bryony told me.<br> <br>I turned my attention to my daughter and smiled. &#x201c;Yes, she is. It&#x2019;s breakfast time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sandra will be upset about her plate. She loved those plates. I&#x2019;ll need to go into town and buy her a new one at Miller&#x2019;s. Least I can do.&#x201d;<br> <br>To anyone else, those words might have sounded sane. Logical. But they were anything but. For starters, Sandra was my grandmamma&#x2019;s sister who had passed away from cancer when I was three years old. And Miller&#x2019;s hadn&#x2019;t been open for business since 1985. The only reason I knew this was because Grandmamma had sent me to fetch something at Miller&#x2019;s when we first moved back and I&#x2019;d started out the door when Momma stopped me and explained. Grandmamma was living in the past. Roy Miller had passed away of a heart attack in &#x2019;85, and his family had closed the store and moved out of Lawton.<br> <br>Instead of reminding her of all this, though, I had found just going along with it was easier. If I told her Sandra was dead or that Miller&#x2019;s was closed, she&#x2019;d go into a fit of hysteria. That was what she knew and remembered today. So I ignored her comment and cleaned up the floor before getting a pot of oats on the stove cooking properly, then disposed of the burned toast out the back door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you know where I put Lyla&#x2019;s applesauce? She needs to eat some this morning. I made it fresh yesterday from the apples I got at Miller&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lyla was my mother. That was another thing that Grandmamma confused. She often thought Bryony was my mother when she was a baby. Again lost in the past.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get her some applesauce. You just sit there and relax. I&#x2019;ll get you some juice. Watch the pretty birds outside. They&#x2019;re eating the birdseed we put out yesterday.&#x201d; That got her attention, and she began watching out the large bay window for the birds.<br> <br>Mom only worked until noon today at the hospital. I would be able to take Bryony out for a walk and to the park after lunch. I needed to get them fed and start the morning chores so we would have plenty of time later to go play. The sun was shining and the warm days were behind us. The cool autumn air was perfect for being outside. And Bryony loved to pick up the different-colored leaves on the ground. She called them her &#x201c;cowection.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Norton Anthology of American Literature Since 1945, Vol. E</h2><p><i>The Norton Anthology of American Literature</i> is the classic survey of American literature from its sixteenth-century origins to its flourishing present.

For a quarter of an hour nobody passed down the narrow street. Such emptiness in this great capital seemed impossible, uncanny, and after a few moments of deep stillness the regular row of houses, covered so evenly by the snowfall, began to lose their shape and identity, to look as if they had nothing at all to do with mankind, but instead belonged to the outer edge of some low, lightless canyon upon a plain, in a distant and lonely and less civilized time.</p><p>Watching from the window of his unlit second-story perch across the way, Charles Lenox began to feel like an intruder upon the scene. In his experience there was a ten-minute period like this lying beyond every London midnight, though its actual time was unpredictable&#x2014;after the last day had ended, before the next day had begun.</p><p>Just as his pocket watch softly chimed for five o&#x2019;clock, however, the human stir returned to Chiltern Street. Abruptly a hunched figure in a dark coat strode past, heading south, and not long afterward the first fire of the day appeared in a low window, a small stubborn orange glow in the darkness. Soon another followed it, three houses down. Lenox wondered who the man had been, whether he was out especially late or especially early, whether his errand was one of mischief or mercy. He had been dressed respectably. A doctor, perhaps. Then again, perhaps not, for he hadn&#x2019;t been carrying the handled leather bag of that breed. A priest? A burglar? Few other professions called for a man to be awake at such an hour.</p><p>Of course, Lenox&#x2019;s was one of them. He was a private detective&#x2014;lying in wait, at this moment, for a murderer.</p><p>Across the street, the light of another fire in its hearth. Now the day was very near beginning. Lenox thought of all the maids of London&#x2014;his own included&#x2014;who woke during the brutal chill of this hour to begin their chores, to light the fires. Then he thought of his wife, Lady Jane Lenox, and their young daughter, Sophia, asleep six streets away, and with a shiver pulled his coat tighter around him. The room where he had waited all night didn&#x2019;t have a fire, since of course he didn&#x2019;t want the light of one to draw attention to his presence here. What a queer way to make a living it was, detection. He smiled. It did make him happy. Even in moments of discomfort.</p><p>Not long before, his life had been very different. It was early January of the year 1876 now; only in October had he finally, after seven years of toil, given up his seat in Parliament. During the last ten months of that period he had been a Junior Lord of the Treasury, drawing a salary of nearly two thousand pounds a year (to some men a very great fortune indeed, in a city where one could live opulently on a tenth of that sum), and it had even been dangled before him that he might, with continued industry and luck, hope one day to compete for a very high office&#x2014;indeed so high an office that one could scarcely utter its name without a feeling of awe. Even on a humbler level he might have remained useful in Parliament indefinitely, he knew. He had both an interest in and a talent for politics, and the discipline that success in that House required.</p><p>But during every hour of those seven years he had missed&#x2014;well, had missed this, the previous work of his life, his vocation, detection, and while the evenings in Parliament had been comfortable, with their beer and chops and amicable companions, they had given him nothing like the thrill of this cold, wearying night. He was where he belonged again: doing what he was most suited to do. It might puzzle the members of his caste (for Lenox was a gentleman, and nearing the age of fifty more rapidly than he would have preferred), but this disreputable line of work gave him greater pleasure than all the authorities and appanages of Parliament ever could. He did not regret going into politics, having long wished to try his hand at the game of it; still less though did he regret leaving the game behind.</p><p>The first carriage of the morning passed down Chiltern Street. Nearly every house had a fire lit below stairs now, in the servants&#x2019; quarters, and in one there was a second bright flicker of heat a story up, where Lenox could see that the head of the family had risen and was taking his early breakfast. A stockbroker, perhaps. They often had to be in the City by seven.</p><p>Another fire, and another.</p><p>Only one house remained dark. It was directly across the street from Lenox&#x2019;s window, and his gaze was focused steadily upon it. Surely the time was coming, he thought. When another carriage rolled down the street he followed its progress intently, before observing that there was a coat of arms on its door. That lost the vehicle his interest. He doubted that his quarry would arrive in such a conspicuous conveyance.</p><p>Another fire. Another carriage. The sky was growing faintly lighter, the absolute darkness of the sky lessening into a black lavender. Soon enough it would be daytime. Perhaps he had been wrong, he felt with a first hint of unease. He was out of practice, after all.</p><p>But then it came: an anonymous gig, a pair of thick-glassed oil lamps swinging from its hood, pulled steadily through the snow by a youthful gray horse.</p><p>It stopped a few houses shy of the one Lenox was observing, and a man stepped down from it, passing a few coins to its driver, who received them with a hand to the brim of his cap and then whipped the horse hard, in haste to be on his way to another fare. Or home, perhaps, who knew. Lenox&#x2019;s eyes were fixed on the person who had dismounted. Certainly it was he. Hughes: Hughes the blackmailer, Hughes the thief, above all Hughes the murderer.</p><p>He was a very small fellow, not more than an inch or two higher than five foot. He was well made, however, with a handsome face and brilliantly shining dark hair. He carried a cloth case with a hard handle.</p><p>Lenox reached up above his right shoulder and gave the taut white string there one hard, decisive pull. He let it quiver for a moment and then stilled it with his hand. His heart was in his throat as he watched the criminal, to see if the man would fly&#x2014;but Hughes continued without any hesitation toward the last dim house in Chiltern Street, the one Lenox had been watching. When he was at the door he peered at the handle for a moment, then opened his case and chose two or three items from it. He set to work on the lock. In what seemed a breathtakingly short time, not more than four or five seconds, he had the door open. It was the skill of a great criminal. He put his tools away quickly and walked inside with quiet steps, closing the door behind him. The house remained dark.</p><p>Lenox stood and smiled. He counted fifteen seconds and then walked toward the door of the room in which he had been sitting most of the night, careful to avoid moving past the windows, where his silhouette might be seen. His joints ached. His eyes felt at once tired and alive with alertness. It wouldn&#x2019;t be more than a moment now.</p><p>It was frigidly cold down on the street, and he was thankful, as he stepped into the snow on the pavement, for his rather odd-looking brown cork-soled boots, which he had ordered specially because they kept out the damp. The rest of his dress was more formal, his daytime attire: a dark suit, pale shirt, dark tie, dark hat, the only gleam of brightness on his person coming from the silver of the watch chain that extended across his slender midsection. He lit a small cigar, put a hand in his pocket, and stood to watch, his curious hazel eyes trained across the street.</p><p>&#x201c;Come along, quickly,&#x201d; he said to himself under his breath. Chiltern Street was growing busier. Two carriages passed in quick succession.</p><p>Then suddenly the brick house opposite&#x2014;the one into which Hughes had slipped so quietly&#x2014;burst from stillness into commotion. A dozen lamps blazed to life, and a dozen voices to match them. When Lenox heard an aggrieved shout, he smiled. It was done. Hughes was captured. He dropped his cigar into the snow, stamped it out with his foot, and then, looking up and down the street to make sure no more carriages were coming, stepped briskly across to witness his victory at firsthand.</p><p>Thirty minutes later Hughes was secured in the back of one of the two wagons from Scotland Yard that stood on Chiltern Street. Enough people were awake and about that a small crowd had gathered nearby, their curiosity triumphing over the cold. Lenox was outside the house with Inspector Nicholson, a tall, bony, hook-nosed young man with a winning grin, which he wore now.</p><p>&#x201c;He took the money in addition to the letters. Couldn&#x2019;t resist it, I suppose. Greedy chap.&#x201d; The dozen pound notes sitting alongside the letters in the desk had been Lenox&#x2019;s idea&#x2014;their theft would make Hughes&#x2019;s crime easier to prosecute. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll need them for evidence, but you&#x2019;ll have them back in a month or two. Along with the rope and the bell.&#x201d;</p><p>Lenox looked up at the thin string toward which Nicholson gestured as he said this, hard to discern unless you were looking for it. It ran tightly overhead from one side of the street to the other; Lenox had used its bell to warn the constables waiting in the Dwyer house, the one that Hughes had entered, in case the thief was armed. Certainly he had shown time and again that he was not above violence. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no rush at all about the money,&#x201d; said Lenox, returning Nicholson&#x2019;s smile. &#x201c;Though I&#x2019;m afraid I must be off now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. The agency?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Our official opening.&#x201d;</p><p>When Lenox had left Parliament, he had agreed to a proposal from his prot�g�, Lord John Dallington, to begin a detective agency&#x2014;a venture that he had contemplated at first with reservations, but that filled him increasingly now with excitement. It would be the best in London. The founders were determined of that.</p><p>The young inspector extended a hand. He was one of the few men at the Yard who didn&#x2019;t look upon the new agency with territorial suspicion, or indeed outright disdain. &#x201c;I wish you only the very best of luck. Though we&#x2019;ll miss the help you&#x2019;ve given us over the last months, of course. Six of the seven names.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Some scores to settle.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And not bad publicity, I imagine.&#x201d;</p><p>Lenox smiled. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>It was true. Lenox had devoted the months of November and December to tracking down some of the old criminals whose freedom had rankled in his bosom, when Parliament had deprived him of the time to try to take it from them. Now the press that would gather in Chancery Lane an hour hence to take photographs and write articles about the agency&#x2019;s opening would have a ready-made angle: Lenox&#x2019;s return to detection prosecuted with single-minded determination over the past months, and resulting already in a safer London. It would bring in business, they hoped.</p><p>What a day of promise! Hughes in a cell, his partners waiting for him, the brass plate upon their door&#x2014;which read LENOX, DALLINGTON, STRICKLAND, AND LEMAIRE&#x2014;ready to be uncovered. Hopefully the broken window of yesterday had been mended; hopefully the office was tidied, ready for the eyes of the press. How right it had been to leave Parliament, he saw now! A new year. The energy one drew from embarking upon a new challenge, a new adventure. He walked briskly down the street, too happy with life to worry about the cold.</p><p>Had he known how miserable he would be in three months&#x2019; time, he would have shaken his head bitterly at that misplaced enthusiasm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Copyright � 2014 by Charles Finch</p></p><h2>Bicycle book</h2><p>Here is a brief history of bicycles, as well as information on the different kinds there are, how they work, and the different ways they are used.

Three titles open this series: <i>Alvar Aalto</i>, <i>Jean Prouv�</i> and <i>Ray and Charles Eames</i>. <br>Best known for their contributions to architecture, furniture design (especially the Eames chair), industrial design, film and photography, Charles and Ray Eames remain among the most renowned American designers of the twentieth century. The couple married in 1941 and moved to California, where they pursued their furniture design in molded plywood. During the war they were commissioned by the U.S. Navy to produce molded plywood splints, stretchers and experimental glider shells. In 1946, Evans Products began producing the Eames' molded plywood furniture. Their iconic molded plywood chair was called "the chair of the century" by the influential architectural critic Esther McCoy. <br>In 1949, Charles and Ray designed and built their own home in Pacific Palisades, their design and imaginative use of materials making this house a mecca for architects and designers internationally. Today it is considered one of the most important postwar residences built anywhere in the world. After the war, the Eames continued to create new furniture designs, such as the Fiberglass Chairs (1950), the famous Lounge Chair and Ottoman (1956), the Time Life stool (1960), the 3473 sofa (1964) and the seating for Dulles and O'Hare airports--a design still in use in lounges around the world today. In the 70s they expanded their operations into cinema, producing many beautiful short films. Charles and Ray received honorary degrees and awards from universities and organizations across the country. The Eames Office still operates today.</p><p></p><h2>Democracy Betrayed: The Wilmington Race Riot of 1898 and Its Legacy</h2><p>At the close of the nineteenth century, the Democratic Party in North Carolina engineered a white supremacy revolution. Frustrated by decades of African American self-assertion and threatened by an interracial coalition advocating democratic reforms, white conservatives used violence, demagoguery, and fraud to seize political power and disenfranchise black citizens.

He reclines in a deck chair in his modern apartment in western India, telling subtle and entertaining folk narratives to his assorted gatherings. Among the listeners is Kirin Narayan, who knew Swamiji when she was a child in India and who has returned from America as an anthropologist. In her book Narayan builds on Swamiji's tales and his audiences' interpretations to ask why religious teachings the world over are so often couched in stories.</p><p>For centuries, religious teachers from many traditions have used stories to instruct their followers. When Swamiji tells a story, the local barber rocks in helpless laughter, and a sari-wearing French nurse looks on enrapt. Farmers make decisions based on the tales, and American psychotherapists take notes that link the storytelling to their own practices. Narayan herself is a key character in this ethnography. As both a local woman and a foreign academic, she is somewhere between participant and observer, reacting to the nuances of fieldwork with a sensitivity that only such a position can bring.</p><p>Each story s reproduced in its evocative performance setting. Narayan supplements eight folk narratives with discussions of audience participation and response as well as relevant Hindu themes. All these stories focus on the complex figure of the Hindu ascetic and so sharpen our understanding of renunciation and gurus in South Asia.</p><p>While <i>Storytellers, Saints, and Scoundrels</i> raises provocative theoretical issues, it is also a moving human document. Swamiji, with his droll characterizations, inventive mind, and generous spirit, is a memorable character. The book contributes to a growing interdisciplinary literature on narrative. It will be particularly valuable to students and scholars of anthropology, folklore, performance studies, religions, and South Asian studies.</p></p><p>Kirin Narayan is Professor of Anthropology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.<p>"This volume is beautifully written, is a delightful read, is theoretically sophisticated, yet presents a rich human portrait of the ethnographer and her informant.

Cohen</strong></p> The collectivization of the peasants in the USSR constituted a social upheaval of a totally unprecedented nature. It was one of the most remarkable events of the present century and it has a history as long as that of Soviet power itself. The idea of a collectivized agriculture, much favoured by the leadership after the revolution, had been left in abeyance during the NEP period. Interest in the idea, and in the collective movement, revived at the time of the &#x2018;grain crisis&#x2019; at the beginning of 1928. It was during this crisis that collectivization of the peasantry and the creation of a powerful kolkhoz and sovkhoz sector began to be taken seriously as a means of solving, at one and the same time, both the formidable problem of grain and the whole &#x2018;accursed problem&#x2019; of relations between the Soviet authorities and the peasants.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>I&#39;ll Be Gone in the Dark</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of March 2018:</strong> <em>I&#x2019;ll Be Gone in the Dark</em>, Michelle McNamara&#x2019;s compelling investigation of the &#x201c;Golden State Killer,&#x201d; who terrorized northern California from the mid-70s to the mid-80s, is one of the best true crime books to come along in a decade. It&#x2019;s the story of two obsessions: McNamara&#x2019;s obsession with the criminal, and whatever abhorrent obsession drove him to commit a series of horrific rapes and murders over ten years. The author, a true crime journalist who created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com, describes the crimes and examines clues in an effort to uncover his identity. Occasionally, she challenges convention by inserting herself into the narrative (at one point, she even writes directly to the Golden State Killer), and the book acquires even more personal weight when one takes into account the fact that McNamara, at the age of 46, died while writing it. Knowing all of this, and with each chilling description, McNamara&#x2019;s obsession begins to become our own. She believed that the Golden State Killer would still be alive today. You will discover yourself hoping she&#x2019;s right, so that you can see him captured and brought to justice. <em>-- Chris Schluep, the Amazon Book Review</em></p><p>You&#x2019;ll be silent forever, and I&#x2019;ll be gone in the dark.</p><p>Over the course of more than ten years, a mysterious and violent predator committed fifty sexual assaults in Northern California before moving south, where he perpetrated ten sadistic murders. In 1986 he disappeared, eluding capture by multiple police forces and some of the best detectives in the area.</p><p>At the time of the crimes, the man journalist Michelle McNamara dubbed the Golden State Killer was between the ages of eighteen and thirty. He always wore a mask. He attacked while his victims slept, using a flashlight to awaken and blind them. Though they could not recognize him, his victims recalled his voice: a guttural whisper through clenched teeth.</p><p><em>I&#x2019;ll Be Gone in the Dark</em>&#x2014;the masterpiece McNamara was writing when she died tragically at the age of forty-six&#x2014;offers an atmospheric snapshot of a moment in American history and a chilling account of a criminal mastermind and the wreckage he left behind. It is also a stunning portrait of a woman&#x2019;s obsession and her unflagging pursuit of the truth.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Baseball in Montgomery (Images of Baseball)</h2><p>In 2004, Riverwalk Stadium ushered in a new era of professional baseball in Montgomery. After a more-than-20-year absence, the new ballpark became a catalyst for the revitalization of downtown Montgomery. Biscuit baseball and Riverwalk Stadium have given citizens something to be proud of. The stadium is nestled between the Alabama River and railroad tracks and incorporates the old Western Railroad building as part of the ballpark. This has made Riverwalk an example for other cities looking to keep their identity and add something new and exciting. Montgomery&#39;s rich baseball history includes hall of fame players like Fred Clarke, Joe McGinnity, Casey Stengel, and Turkey Stearnes.

At the close of his career, Goat Walker played two years with Selma but was hobbled by injuries. In 1950, Walker took the mound for the last time in his professional baseball career. He made a start for the Cloverleafs but was hit in the leg with a screaming line drive. The fans heard the crack of the bat and the crack of Walker's bone. He was carried off the field.

Once the prisoner of a spell, locked in the sleep of innocence - now she is the prisoner of sensual love, held fast by the magic of desire. Claimed by the Prince as the slave of his passions, Sleeping Beauty learns that tenderness and cruelty, pleasure and pain, longing and fulfilment are all one in the awesome kingdom of love. Beauty she is - but she is sleeping no more.</p><p><b>PREFACE</b> <p></p> <p>I&#x2019;ve always loved the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty, and found something erotic at its core. The Prince awakens Beauty with a kiss. And I thought, all right, what if he brought a kind of liberation, an induction into a world of bizarre yet irresistible delights? It has to be remembered that within the frame of a sadomasochistic fantasy like the Beauty trilogy, the readers are invited to identify with and enjoy the predicament of the slaves. The books aren&#x2019;t about literal cruelty; they&#x2019;re about surrender, the fun of imagining you have no choice but to enjoy sex. Beauty&#x2019;s slavery is delicious, sensuous, abandoned, and ultimately liberating. This is all part of the framework. And it seemed to work exquisitely with the old fairy tale. And of course the fairy tale removes us from everyday life; it removes us from the intrusion of garish headlines, literal violence, and all the ugliness of crime. We go into a gilded dream here, luscious and engulfing, in which we&#x2019;re free to imagine all sorts of things&#x2014;a fairy-tale world indeed.</p> <p>As Anne Rice, I&#x2019;m known for certain kinds of novels; the Roquelaure books retain the name Roquelaure (even with my name added) to indicate that this is something &#x201c;different.&#x201d; If Anne Rice is one kind of savory dish, well this is another entirely. And some might find it far too spicy for their taste. I don&#x2019;t like the idea of confusing or disappointing readers, so the pen name helps with that. Of course, there are many people who have read all my work, including the Roquelaure novels, and they see me as a multifaceted writer. But the Roquelaure material is erotica, without reservation, and it needs that pen name on the label, so to speak. The pen name says: Anne Rice is doing something very different here.</p> <p>I felt I needed the anonymity of the pen name to write freely, to pursue an authentic erotica without being inhibited or self-conscious. And it worked wonders to imagine myself &#x201c;cloaked&#x201d; by the name Roquelaure, which is a kind of French cloak&#x2014;named after the Frenchman who popularized it. My father was still living then and I didn&#x2019;t want him to know about the books either. In fact, there were lots of friends and relatives whom I didn&#x2019;t want to worry about as I developed the writing. There was quite a bit of exposure involved in writing such graphic sexual fantasies. It was frightening now and then, and it was thrilling. Eventually, I told my father about the books, asking him not to read them, and I did put my name on them. I adjusted completely to people knowing I&#x2019;d written them. But only after I&#x2019;d finished with the trilogy&#x2014;as I recall.</p> <p>A pen name enables you not only to cloak what you are doing from friends and family; it gives you a new freedom to do something you would not do as yourself. I have thought of writing some new erotica, and I must confess I imagined using a new pen name for it. I don&#x2019;t know whether I&#x2019;ll pursue it, but I do find the freedom of the pen name attractive.</p> <p>When the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy books were first published, they were underground books. They had the backing of a major mainstream publisher, yes, but the publication, though dignified and beautiful, was relatively quiet. But different readers embraced the books almost at once. They clearly appealed to young people, and older married people, to gays and straights. And they&#x2019;ve sold steadily ever since they first appeared. Women come up to me at signings with babies in strollers and giggle and laugh and say, &#x201c;We love your dirty books.&#x201d; People of all ages, actually, present the books to be signed.</p> <p>Why do I think these particular books have been popular? Two reasons. First, I think it is because they involve no harsh, garish violence at all. They involve game playing, really. No one is burned or cut or hurt. Certainly no one is killed. Indeed the whole sadomasochistic predicament is presented as a glorified game played out in luxurious rooms and with very attractive people, and involving very attractive slaves. There are endless motifs offered for dominance and submission, for surrender and love. It&#x2019;s like a theme park of dominance and submission, a place to go to enjoy the fantasy of being overpowered by a beautiful man or woman and delightfully compelled to surrender and feel keening pleasure, without the slightest serious harm. I think it&#x2019;s authentic to the way many who share this kind of fantasy really feel. I think what makes it work for people is the combination of the very graphic and unsparing sexual details mixed with the elegant fairy-tale world.</p> <p>Unfortunately a lot of hackwork pornography is written by those who don&#x2019;t share the fantasy, and they slip into hideous violence and ugliness, thinking the market wants all that, when the market never really did. Second, this is shamelessly erotic. It pulls no punches at being what it is. It&#x2019;s excessive and it is erotica. Before these books, a lot of women read what were called &#x201c;women&#x2019;s romances&#x201d; where they had to mark the few &#x201c;hot pages&#x201d; in the book. I said, well, look, try this. Maybe this is what you really want, and you don&#x2019;t have to mark the hot pages because every page is hot. Every page is about sexual fulfillment. Every page is meant to give you pleasure. There are no boring parts. Yet it&#x2019;s very &#x201c;romantic.&#x201d; And well, I think this worked.</p> <p>Lots of people enjoy imagining themselves passive, in the hands of a beautiful lover, male or female, who will force them to enjoy themselves. It&#x2019;s a common idea, and it cuts across gender and class. Men love these sorts of fantasies as much as women. And these books offer all kinds of gender combinations; women dominating men and women; men dominating men and women. The books offer ornate and seductive variations on the themes; and all of it is interwoven in stories with real characters, and again, the emphasis is on a lush, sensuous realm in which all this happens. There are very detailed descriptions of physical interaction and response; but the fairy-tale spell is sustained.</p> <p>I also went all the way with exploring the mind-set of sadomasochism as I saw it, letting the fantasy characters talk in depth about what they felt and what they enjoyed and what thrilled them as they were humiliated and overwhelmed. I suspect that for some readers, this kind of deep exploration of the mentality of the participants was entirely new.</p> <p>Is this why they appealed to so many, because people want this very combination of elements? Perhaps.</p> <p>I certainly never found the combination of elements I wanted in anyone else&#x2019;s erotica. So I offered what I could not find; a light touch; elegance; preciseness; a dreamlike kingdom; a dream in which people explore their need to be passive and to &#x201c;pretend&#x201d; that someone gorgeous and irresistible is &#x201c;making&#x201d; them do it.</p> <p>Psychiatrists have written volumes on the nature of the sadomasochistic fantasy, but when I wrote the trilogy I didn&#x2019;t know of any fiction that really enabled you to slide in it and &#x201c;play&#x201d; the way I wanted to play. So I wrote the books I couldn&#x2019;t find.</p> <p>I never thought a book as eccentric as <i>Interview with the Vampire</i> would have mass appeal. I only knew that I wanted to &#x201c;be with the vampire&#x201d; in the story, tell it from his point of view. I wanted to be inside his head and heart and reveal his voice and his pain. Now as it turned out, other people were exploring this same kind of thing&#x2014;the backstory of the villain, the monster, or the comic book hero and heroine who&#x2019;d always been described from a distance or in brittle form. People wanted to explore all kinds of super characters and hear their intimate musings. And I began to see more and more of this&#x2014;movies made in which Superman could bear his soul, and Lois Lane could really talk about what it meant to love him. The demand for such romantic fantasies grew and grew. But did I have any idea that would happen? No. I wrote what I wanted to read. Well, the same thing is true with the Beauty books.</p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t know whether that many other people had the fantasies. After all, we didn&#x2019;t talk much about them. Only a small elite knew about the mysterious <i>Story of O</i>. But I knew I had these fantasies, and I wanted to share them, and I felt an overwhelming desire to do them &#x201c;right.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t want to compromise, water them down, or shrink from the most humiliating detail. I wanted to really delve into intense sensuous pleasure but put a gilded frame around a safe place for the reader from which he or she could go and come with ease.</p> <p>Of course these books have from time to time been banned. I never expected a library to stock the Beauty trilogy. I know that many libraries respond to community standards, and I just never thought about it much at all. I did notice and I couldn&#x2019;t help notice that the books sold well and steadily, and that at every signing I gave, people brought them to be signed. Recently, I&#x2019;ve signed as many copies of the Beauty books as I have of any other book I&#x2019;ve written. So I don&#x2019;t worry too much about being banned. I&#x2019;ve always shocked people. Years ago, I published a novel about the eighteenth-century castrati opera singers, titled <i>Cry to Heaven</i>. Someone brought a copy back to a bookstore in Stockton, California, and demanded his money back. &#x201c;This is pornography,&#x201d; he said. There are always some people objecting to what I do. I&#x2019;m grateful the Beauty books have been embraced and sustained over the years.</p> <p>As a feminist, I&#x2019;m very much supportive of equal rights for women in all walks of life. And that includes for me the right of every woman to write out her sexual fantasies and to read books filled with sexual fantasies that she enjoys. Men have always enjoyed all kinds of pornography. How can it be wrong for women to have the same right? We&#x2019;re sexual beings! And fantasy is where we can do the things we can&#x2019;t do in ordinary life. A woman has a right to imagine herself carried away by a handsome prince, and to choose for herself as she writes, the color of his hair and eyes, and imagine his silky voice. She has a right to make him as tall as she wants and as strong as he wants. Why not? Men have always allowed themselves such fantasies.</p> <p>Famous madams have told us for decades that powerful men love to be dominated and come to them for role playing that allows the male client to be passive. In fact, some madams have said that men who enjoy playing the passive role are often men who are very powerful in real life. Well, women today are more powerful than ever. They&#x2019;re Supreme Court judges, senators, doctors, lawyers, entrepreneurs, executives, soldiers, cops. They can excel in all walks of life. And why shouldn&#x2019;t they be able to go home from the courtroom, the university, or the office and kick back and &#x201c;pretend&#x201d; they&#x2019;re being swept away to the Queen&#x2019;s sadomasochistic kingdom where all the fairy-tale court will watch them being ravaged by the handsome Prince?</p> <p>The literary world today is wide open for all kinds of creative endeavors. We are in a new golden age in which fantasy, science fiction, speculative fiction, historical drama, horror, gothic, and supernatural romance are all mainstream. Well, the same holds true now obviously for erotica. People in general are &#x201c;out of the closet&#x201d; as enjoyers of erotic books. The novel <i>50 Shades of Grey</i> has proved this. And I am discovering that the Beauty books in spite of all their playful excess&#x2014;are for the first time going mainstream.</p> <p>But I wouldn&#x2019;t continue Beauty&#x2019;s story. I felt that ended just the way I wanted. But I might write some more. I don&#x2019;t think I did all I could do in these books, within the fantasy itself, in admitting how much the slaves enjoyed it&#x2014;how they loved it. I&#x2019;d deepen that aspect, and still keep the tension, if I did them today.</p> <p>People are much more comfortable today admitting and talking about what they enjoy in fiction and film. Much more. People are &#x201c;out of the closet&#x201d; about sexuality, period. The whole world knows women are sensual human beings as well as men. It&#x2019;s no secret anymore that women want to read sexy fiction just as men do, and there&#x2019;s a new frankness about the varieties of fantasies one might enjoy. So many clich�s have been broken and abandoned. And this is a wonderful thing.</p> <p>&#x2014;ANNE RICE</p> <p>JUNE 2012</p>A Roquelaure is the pen name of Ann Rice, a well published author of various gothic vamprire novels.

Feeling unfulfilled, burned out, or just plain unhappy with what we&#x2019;re doing, we long to make that leap into the unknown. But we also hold on, white-knuckled, to the years of time and effort we&#x2019;ve invested in our current profession.<br><br>In this powerful book, Herminia Ibarra presents a new model for career reinvention that flies in the face of everything we&#x2019;ve learned from "career experts." While common wisdom holds that we must first know what we want to do before we can act, Ibarra argues that this advice is backward. Knowing, she says, is the result of doing and experimenting. Career transition is not a straight path toward some predetermined identity, but a crooked journey along which we try on a host of "possible selves" we might become.<br><br>Based on her in-depth research on professionals and managers in transition, Ibarra outlines an active process of career reinvention that leverages three ways of "working identity": experimenting with new professional activities, interacting in new networks of people, and making sense of what is happening to us in light of emerging possibilities.<br><br>Through engrossing stories?from a literature professor turned stockbroker to an investment banker turned novelist?Ibarra reveals a set of guidelines that all successful reinventions share. She explores specific ways that hopeful career changers of any background can:<br><br>Explore possible selves<br>Craft and execute "identity experiments"<br>Create "small wins" that keep momentum going<br>Survive the rocky period between career identities<br>Connect with role models and mentors who can ease the transition<br>Make time for reflection?without missing out on windows of opportunity<br>Decide when to abandon the old path in order to follow the new<br>Arrange new events into a coherent story of who we are becoming.<br><br>A call to the dreamer in each of us, <i>Working Identity</i> explores the process for crafting a more fulfilling future. Where we end up may surprise us.<br></p><p>"Herminia Ibarra has written one of the year&#x2019;s most important business books. Sophisticated and savvy, it challenges much of the conventional wisdom about how and why people change careers&#x2014;and illuminates the experimentation, struggle, and joy that are essential to the process. For professionals contemplating a career change, Working Identity is essential reading." <br>&#x2014;Daniel H. Pink, author of Free Agent Nation <p>"Through countless stories that inspire because they come so close to our own, Ibarra provides a world-shifting breakthrough in how we can go about refining our lives and changing our careers. She has given us long-awaited, enormously practical, and deeply insightful wisdom about the improvisational nature of our selves and our professional development." <br>&#x2014;Ronald A. Heifetz, Cofounder, The Center for Public Leadership, Harvard University, Kennedy School of Government and coauthor of Leadership on the Line: Staying Alive through the Dangers of Leading </p><p>"Career and life transitions are as certain as death and taxes, and we are prone to face them with the same fear and anxiety. Working Identity affords us the courage of common sense. Ibarra's in-depth research and sharp insights show that successful transitions occur one step at a time, by trial and error, experimentation, and incremental experience." <br>&#x2014;Randy Komisar, Virtual CEO and author of The Monk and the Riddle </p><p>"Working Identity is one of those rare and wonderful books that combines deep knowledge drawn from careful research with practical ideas that can be put to immediate use. The book&#x2019;s message of hope and possibility&#x2014;that it is possible to reinvent careers and lives&#x2014;should be embraced by everyone thinking about transitions in today&#x2019;s turbulent world." <br>&#x2014;Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Harvard Business School, author of World Class and Evolve: Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow</p>Herminia Ibarra is Professor of Organizational Behavior at INSEAD in Fontainebleau, France.</p><h2>The Illustrated Letters of Virginia Woolf</h2><p>The moving story of the life and work of novelist Virginia Woolf, revealed through her own letters to those closest to her.The letters - at times witty and irreverent, at times melancholy and introspective &#x2013; are possibly even more revealing for their insights into the complex personality of the novelist herself. "A true letter", she insisted, "should be like a film of wax pressed close to the graving of the mind". The book contains biographical notes on the main recipients of the letters, together with background information on Virginia Woolf's life and work.

The Japanese react by dispatching hundreds of suicide bombers against the Allied fleet surrounding Okinawa. By mid-May, the Allied fleet is losing a major ship a day to murderous swarms of kamikazes streaming out of Formosa and southern Japan. The radar picket line is the first defense and early warning against these hellish formations, but the Japanese direct special attention to these lone destroyers stationed north and west of Okinawa.</p><p>P. T. Deutermann is the author of sixteen previous novels, including Ghosts of Bungo Suido and Pacific Glory, which won the W. Y. Boyd Literary Award for Excellence in Military Fiction. He spent twenty-six years in military and government service, which included a Pearl Harbor tour of duty; his father was a commodore on the Okinawa picket line; and Deutermann&#x2019;s uncle, both of his brothers, and both of his children were naval officers. He lives with his wife in North Carolina.When Connie Miles signs on as executive officer of the destroyer USS Malloy in 1945, he knows he has a lot of learning to do in a very short time: life on a destroyer is considerably different from life on an aircraft carrier, where Miles had been a gunnery officer. Soon Miles begins to suspect that the ship&#x2019;s respected and popular captain is showing signs of mental instability (the Malloy has been under near-constant attack for an extended period of time). Can a raw executive officer and a crew who need a captain&#x2019;s leadership complete their latest mission without cracking under the pressure? With echoes of both Thomas Heggen&#x2019;s Mr. Roberts (1946) and Herman Wouk&#x2019;s The Caine Mutiny (1952), in which a junior officer must try to maintain the efficiency and spirit of the crew under a captain&#x2019;s relentlessly mean and vicious command, this is an excellent WWII naval adventure from an author whose backlist includes the award-winning Pacific Glory (2011), among other military-themed novels. --David Pitt</p><h2>Transformation of Suffering: A Handbook for Practitioners</h2><p>Drikung Bhande Dharmaradza (1704-1754) maps out, in verse, the entire structure of the Buddhist Path.

Now a top homicide inspector under democratic rule, he still knows how to turn the screws on a tough suspect. But he is not so adept at playing politics with department heads, government ministers, and the media. So when two TV reporters turn up murdered in Athens, he needs to find a likely culprit fast. The plot, which hinges on a child-smuggling ring, provides plenty of satisfying twists. But the book's real joy lies in the wry, sly voice of its cranky protagonist. It's as if legendary columnist Mike Royko was reincarnated as a wily Greek cop. When Haritos isn't tossing out acerbic criticisms of contemporary Greek society, he is engaged in an amusingly passive-aggressive dance with his wife, Adriani, who gives at least as good as she gets. Considering her faked orgasms, Haritos muses, "If every time it happened I nabbed her and took her in, by now she'd have got life for repeated fraud." But while the climaxes may be phony, the relationship remains refreshingly real. <i>Frank Sennett</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Sorrow, grief, and pain pervade Hambly's outstanding ninth Benjamin January mystery (after 2004's <i>Dead Water</i>), set in New Orleans during the summer of 1836. Trapped by poverty and the color of his skin, January, a free black who trained in France as a physician, goes undercover as a piano player in a high-class bordello to investigate possible embezzlement from the Faubourg Trem� Free Colored Militia and Burial Society.

If living as a free black in nineteenth-century New Orleans wasn&#x2019;t enough to set January apart, his classical education, years of living in Paris, and knowledge of medicine made him truly unusual. Although January&#x2019;s past investigations have earned him respect from many in his native city, his endeavors to save the life of an uncooperative young lord accused of murder are still hampered by long-held secrets and by vicious racism that puts January&#x2019;s life at risk, time and again. Relayed through January&#x2019;s perspective, the story gives an intimate picture of the intolerance and struggles of the time, but as carefully crafted as these matters are, Hambly is also talented enough to entertain. That&#x2019;s two successes for the price of one. --Stephanie Zvirin</p><h2>Doing Sixty and Seventy</h2><p>Doing Sixty and Seventy By Gloria Steinem Gloria Steinem became a spokesperson for issues about aging quite accidentally after declaring to a reporter on the occasion of her fortieth birthday, &#34;This is what forty looks like. We&#39;ve been lying for so long, who would know?&#34; Because of this casual comment about her age and about the collective societal pressure to lie about our age she received an avalanche of thanks and support from other women facing age discrimination. This caused her to realize the far reaching dimensions of age oppression. In her inspiring essay, Doing Sixty, Steinem shares her views on age stereotyping, the unexpected liberation that comes with growing older, and defines what she perceives as the fact that women become more radical as they age. The essay also sheds light on the forces that shaped her life and for readers who have only heard bits and pieces about her the essay offers a primer on her bold and logical theories. In the essay, Steinem describes turning fifty as &#34;leaving a much-loved and familiar country&#34; and turning sixty &#34;as arriving at the border of a new one&#34; in which she looked forward to &#34;trading moderation for excess, defiance for openness, and planning for the unknown.&#34; In the Preface, Doing Seventy, written when Steinem is just past seventy and twelve years after the essay was first published, Steinem explains the development of her precious sense of mortality and time. Elders Academy Press is proud to have published Ms. Steinem&#39;s enlightening and thought-provoking essay thus allowing it to appear for the first time as an independent volume.</p><p>Gloria Steinem remains the United States&#39; most influential, eloquent and revered feminist more than three decades after founding Ms. magazine. A devoted activist and writer, Steinem continues, as she has for more than thirty-five years, to travel nationally and internationally and speak with a calm voice of reason and articulation about gender, racial, and other civil inequity issues.</p><h2>Martin John</h2><p><p><b>Finalist for the 2015 Giller Prize</b></p><p><b>Among <i>The National Post's</i> Top 5 Books of 2015</b></p><p><b>Among <i>The Toronto Star's</i> Top 5 Fiction Books of 2015</b></p><p><b>Among <i>Largehearted Boy</i>'s Favourite Novels of 2015</b></p><p><b>One of <i>Quill &amp; Quire&#x2019;s</i> Books of the Year, 2015</b></p><p><b>Among <i>The Edmonton Journal's</i> Top 5 Books of 2015</b></p><p><b>A 49th Shelf Book of the Year, 2015</b></p><p><b>Among <i>NOW Toronto's</i> Top 10 Books of 2015</b></p><p>Martin John&#x2019;s mam says that she is glad he is done with it.
